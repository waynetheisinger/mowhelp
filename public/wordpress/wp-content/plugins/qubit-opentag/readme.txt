We’ve developed OpenTag to meet the demands of all leading enterprises. The product set is comprehensive, featuring Container Tag, Universal Tag, CPA De-Duplication and Cookie Consent. Whilst these products are pretty much the norm in Tag Management circles, the real OpenTag difference lies in our approach to creating an exceedingly flexible, developer-friendly and ‘Enterprise class’ solution.

OpenTag is runs on an open source data model. This means our code is completely stable and yours to customize. It also means that, unlike our competitor’s products, you won’t be locked into our solution or burdened with heavy transfer costs should you wish to re-platform.

Depending on your needs, OpenTag can be self service or managed. The former lets you try the product straight from our website whilst the latter takes the work off your hands and allows us to help with strategy and planning. In addition, OpenTag can be hosted on your side or through us; we use Amazon CloudFront, an extremely secure platform that allows rapid scalability coupled with low operating costs.

In terms of cost, we’re extremely competitive. OpenTag is free for sites with less than 1m pageviews per month and only costs $99 for each 10m pageviews thereafter. In part, this is due to our hosting approach, but also because we believe managing third party technologies is just the first step towards creating a responsive, personalised and profitable online businesses - QuBit’s core mission.
