Congratulations. You are now in possession of groundbreaking technology that will make working in your garden easier cleaner, less hassle, with advanced, lighter, more powerful battery tools than ever before. </p>\n<p>We are keen that you get the very best performance from your battery powered lawn mower from the very first time you ‘charge-up and go’. Subsequently, we hope the following guidelines and advice will help. They are based on our extensive experience, with reference to the sorts of questions new cordless lawnmower mower users regularly ask us.</p>\n<p>As a preliminary tip, do read your manuals and instruction sheets thoroughly before you start and keep them to hand while you get used to your machine. They will offer you advice you may well need.<strong><em> </em></strong></p>\n<p><strong> Assembly</strong>: Your new battery powered mower will arrive ‘boxed' and there is a minimal element of assembly. This is usually, though not always, limited to attaching the 'Handlebars' and 'Grass catcher' .</p>\n<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> Before you start mowing, check your lawn is clear of obstacles. Children’s toys, large sticks and similar. You would be amazed how many calls we get regarding a mower that has given up half-way across the lawn only to find out it was caused by an old toy lurking in the long grass!</p>\n<p><strong> </strong><strong>Starting</strong>: If you are have difficulty starting your machine, it is always advisable to check the following</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure your battery or batteries are correctly charged as per the instructions in the manual.</li>\n<li>Check the battery or batteries to see if they are fitted properly and securely in place.</li>\n<li>Ensure you are holding in the 'OPC Bar' (Operator Presence Control). If you are not holding this in you will be unable to pull out the recoil. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Storage:</strong> Storing your mower in the right place is important but there are extra considerations when storing a battery powered model</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure you store your cordless mower in a dry place, covered if possible. Always give it a wipe-over before storage and never store the mower with grass or mud left on it. Never leave or attempt to store them  them in a humid environment.</li>\n<li>Before storing your cordless mower away for a long time, make sure the battery is partially charged, perhaps somewhere between 30 and 70% depending on the time they are being stored. Storing on a full charge can reduce the battery life and storing on no charge can make re-charging later potentially difficult.</li>\n<li>Try to make sure you store your battery or batteries at a reasonable temperature, not in any extremes of hot and cold as this can also affect the charging cycles and battery life, make sure you don’t store them near or on boilers or radiators and avoid leaving them in a hot car or by a window in the sun.</li>\n<li>Try to ensure that batteries are not stored in such a way that metal can touch the contacts as this can damage them and is, potentially, dangerous. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Performance: </strong>If you are having trouble collecting grass or you think the mower is not cutting or running properly, here are some things to consider.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Again, make sure your battery or batteries are charged correctly</li>\n<li>Don’t try to cut very wet grass as this can result in clogging and poor performance</li>\n<li>Check the cutting height is set correctly. If you are having trouble with the grass and the mower feels sluggish, this could well be the problem.</li>\n<li>Avoid touching the battery contacts as this can affect battery performance. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Grass and Mud: </strong>Wet and rotting grass causes metal components to rust and grass and dirt in or around the blades can cause all sorts of problems. Always make sure you clean the cutting deck regularly and thoroughly.</p>\n<p>If your mower does not have a 'Deck Wash Port' (an attachment for a hose) you will need to tip the machine to clear the deck from beneath. It is best to tip from front to back so that the machine pivots/rests on the back wheels.</p>\n<p><strong>Servicing</strong>: Don’t forget that Annual Servicing is recommended by the manufacturers and is a requirement if you want to extend the guarantee beyond the first year.</p>\n<p> And finally, we’d like to thank you for your custom. Hopefully these tips and guidelines will help you enjoy your new mower and get trouble free and satisfactory operation from it.

Robot mowers do not usually collect grass clippings, so those small cuttings of grass fall back into the lawn, acting as mulch, breaking down and helping to feed more nutrients into the lawn so it is more luxuriant, green and healthy looking.  </span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Robotic lawnmowers are generally very quiet and, being powered by long running, fast charging, Lithium-Ion batteries, are reasonably environmentally sound, emitting no fumes and requiring no petrol. </span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">They are safe to use as well. They will stop, and stop cutting, if they hit an obstacle and will go off in another direction.

It should be decidedly warmer now. Spring flowers have come and gone and your vegetables and plants should be flourishing.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Assuming Jack Frost has finally gone on his summer holidays, if you want to create swathe of colour in the flower garden, you <strong>can make room in your beds </strong>by moving your spring bulbs. Try using a good quality <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue110\">trowel. </span> Then you can start to<strong> plant summer bedding plants like fuchsias, begonias or petunias. </strong>You can also plant busy lizzies, marigolds, and pansies.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Meanwhile, the aphids will be out in force, particularly if it is very warm and moist right now, and they are looking for a good sit down meal. Flowering plants are all at risk. The aphid genus include includes blackfly, greenfly,  woolly aphids and in fact, pests of all shapes and sizes are flourishing as much as anything else, carrot fly, cabbage root fly, so now is the time to put your foot down and try to prevent or control them. Remember, carefully<strong> inspecting the underside of leaves and keeping your lawn, beds and everywhere else tidy </strong>and free of discarded or rotting vegetation is a major way of keeping pest and disease free. Always have a <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue110\">decent rake</span> handy. You might want to use a <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">pesticide or insecticide<span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\"> in</span></span> which case, make sure you have an efficient <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue110\">garden sprayer</span> around  (<em>see image below</em>)</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><em>Solo 475/D Diaphragm-Pump Backpack Sprayer</em></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"> <img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200525697/SOLO_475_BACK_PACK_SPRAYER_400H.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"206\" height=\"221\"></span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Any spring flowering shrubs will now need cutting back</strong>.

For the veggy grower, <strong>it is time to sow Beetroot, carrots, lettuce, peas summer cabbage, to harvest your French beans, rhubarb, early carrots, spring onions, and in late June, your new potatoes</strong>.

They will have wider cutting widths and are designed for  more multi-purpose use than rear engine riders, able to tow heavier attachments. They will tend to have decks with two contra-rotating blades for a wider cut.

This is usually limited to attaching the 'Handlebars' and 'Grass catcher' .</p>\n<p><strong>Fuel:</strong> Your new lawnmower has a 4-Stroke engine, so Oil and Petrol are put in separate compartments, no mixing required.</p>\n<p><strong>Petrol</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Modern fuel contains ethanol, which absorbs moisture and causes the fuel to deteriorate in as little as 30 days, causing damage and starting issues if left in the tank. Our suggested solution is either drain the tank if are going to leave it for a while or always add fuel stabilising additive to all fuel before filling up your tank.</li>\n<li>For the same reasons you should only put 'Fresh Unleaded Petrol' in your tank. Old fuel will degrade quickly if it has not already done so.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Oil</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is important not to under-fill or over-fill your machine. Please refer to your manufacturers guidelines as to the quantity.</li>\n<li>Regular oil changes protect your engine from damage and excessive wear. Do refer to your ‘Engine’ manual regarding schedules for regular oil changes.</li>\n<li>Not all models come with oil in the box and none with oil in the tank. It is advisable to check and have some ready just in case. The type should be 10/30 Lawnmower Grade Oil, otherwise known as SAE 30.</li>\n<li>Oil needs to be changed after the first 5 hours of use. Running in of the machine can cause minute particles of metal debris in the engine, which an oil change and flush removes safely.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Starting</strong>: If you are have difficulty starting your machine, it is always advisable to check the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure you are holding in the 'OPC Bar' (Operator Presence Control). If you are not holding this in you will be unable to pull out the recoil.</li>\n<li>If you have a 'Fuel Switch', please ensure this is on.</li>\n<li>If there is a 'Primer', check you have primed the machine.</li>\n<li>If there is a 'Throttle', check that this is fully on to start the machine and then reduce the throttle once the machine has started</li>\n<li>If there is any blockage of the main carburettor jet, you engine won't start so this is worth checking. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Throttle:</strong> Again, if there is a throttle on your model, do remember that it does not affect the speed of the machine, it simply reduces or increases the 'Revs' of the engine.</p>\n<p><strong>Storage:</strong> Petrol Lawnmower engines are not waterproof. So make sure you store yours in a dry place, covered if possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Rollers: </strong>A regular check-up on the state of your front/and/or rear roller is important.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Look for wear on the shaft and the bearings as wear can affect the cut, especially. </li>\n<li>Check that the rollers are spinning freely. If not, look for grass or other debris clogging up the shaft or lubricate the roller if it has grease nipples. If it does not and you cannot identify the cause of the stiffness, try to strip the roller to lubricate it or contact your local dealer to do this for you. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Grass and Mud: </strong>Wet and rotting grass causes metal components to rust and grass and dirt in or around the engine can cause overheating and damage. It can also affect your roller and you blades.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Always make sure you clean the cutting deck regularly and thoroughly.</li>\n<li>You will need to tip the machine to clear the deck from beneath. Use a hose, and then a brush, soap and hot water.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>NB</strong>: B<em>e careful when tipping as you can cause the oil to flood the air filter. This can contaminate your spark plug and carburettor. Always switch your mower off and, preferably, disconnect the spark plug before you go near the deck or blades. </em></p>\n<p><strong>Servicing</strong>: Don’t forget that Annual Servicing is recommended by the manufacturers and is a requirement if you want to extend the guarantee beyond the first year. Out of tune engines and blunt blades can result in poor cutting, poor collection, and environmental pollution. This best done before you over-winter your mower. </p>\n<p>And finally, we sincerely hope that these guidelines will help you, and that you enjoy your cylinder mower.

If your lawn mower gives up the ghost or you just feel it’s time to go for a new one, make sure you go for one that suits your size and style of garden. for more information see the articles in our  <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue110\">Buying Guide to Lawn Mowers</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">You’ll be harvesting lots of vegetables at the moment, but don’t get so carried away with your sack loads of fabulous produce that you forget to plan for the winter. Getting your winter vegetables in now means you will have something to eat in the cold months and if there is no room in the beds, try putting them in pots until such as time as there is space. There should still be enough time to <strong>get some last French beans in </strong>for the autumn months and<strong> keep sowing those lettuces and radishes.</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">If you are going away on holiday don’t forget to have someone check your garden or plot for you and in return? Well, fresh vegetables on tap are always a good incentive!</span></p>"},{"id":201996168,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/201996168.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201996168-What-accessories-are-available-for-a-ride-on-mower-or-tractor","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":6,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200262686,"created_at":"2014-02-14T15:30:34Z","updated_at":"2015-04-15T15:40:44Z","name":"What accessories are available for a ride-on mower or tractor","title":"What accessories are available for a ride-on mower or tractor","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2015-04-15T15:40:44Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<p>Ride on mowers and garden tractors can be very flexible and are rarely restricted to cutting grass alone.</p>\r\n<p>There are a variety of attachments made to go with them.

This is usually done with a mulch-plug, often a simple and effective plastic block with a handle (<em>see fig 1 below</em>) which you push into the grass exit channel manually.  Some models of mower come with an integrated ‘sliding-door’ type system operated by a lever. The rest is up to the blade.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-small\">Mulch Plug </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/202186889/mulch_plugweb.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"235\" height=\"152\"></span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Mulching lawnmowers are fitted with a different blade from normal mowers. This blade creates an airflow that enables the cutting and re-cutting of the clippings until they are shredded and miniscule. (<em>See image below.)</em></span></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200341906/mow_mulching_diagram.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"575\" height=\"181\"></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">The vacuum created by the blade means the now clippings are then forced downwards into the turf where they break down quickly and provide nitrogen and phosphates, which permeate the soil to increase the health of the lawn.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">The decks of dedicated mulching lawn mowers are designed specifically for this purpose, rounded and sealed, creating the perfect airflow to recycle clippings around the cutting area and back down through the blades rather than throwing them back. </span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">The advantages of this are worth considering. This process can be very good indeed for your lawn, providing extra nutrients to the turf, creating a greener looking and healthier lawn and it is a great way of recycling mowing waste.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Mulching capable mowers do a good job, but ultimately, if mulching is your aim, a dedicated mulching mower is the best model for you. </span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">If you would like to view our range of mulching and mulching capable lawn mowers, click here <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue110\">mulching mowers</span></span></span></p>"},{"id":201173467,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/201173467.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201173467-What-are-the-advantages-of-a-submersible-pump-","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":6,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200311153,"created_at":"2014-01-06T14:38:17Z","updated_at":"2014-04-23T15:20:54Z","name":"What are the advantages of a submersible pump?","title":"What are the advantages of a submersible pump?","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2014-01-06T14:38:17Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<div>Submersible pumps will be powered by electricity.

Late summer and well into the school holidays… time to get your kids working in the garden. The nights aren’t exactly drawing in, but June seems a memory away and autumn will no doubt be sneaking around soon with it’s offer of conkers and pretty leaves. Take no notice. Enjoy the last of the summer in your garden, <strong>get out your mower and give that lawn a good seeing to</strong>. If your garden is large, and you are wondering about the eight hour walk just to mow it, why not think about a <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue110\">Ride-on Mower</span>, like the example below. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><em><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-small\">Honda HF 1211 S Ride-On Mower</span></em></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><em><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-small\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200461038/Honda-HF1211S-Lawn-Tractor-2011-520w.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"252\" height=\"215\"></span></em></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">You may be thinking of storing stuff by now, getting your produce into sacks, making sure its all dry and free from anything creepy and crawly and keeping it somewhere safe.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Onions can now be pulled out and prepared for storage.</strong> Use a good <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue110\">garden fork</span> and make sure you don’t damage the onions themselves. Dry them out somewhere warm, on a table in the sun perhaps, so they stop growing and make sure they get stored in a cool and dry place. It’s good time to harvest herbs and dry or freeze them for use over the autumn You will probably be harvesting radishes, carrots, French beans, runner beans, lettuces, spring onions and peas as well as cucumbers and courgettes. If you didn’t do it in July, <strong>make sure you sow some greens</strong> like perpetual spinach, rocket, pak choi, winter greens like chard and kale, land cress or spring greens to transplant in September or October. Keep on planting leeks and cauliflower if you have the space. <strong>Be careful to water well</strong>, make sure your water doesn’t just evaporate in the heat and vanish before it has done any good. If you've made sure you have saved your rainwater, you could use a <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue110\">rain barrel water pump</span> to irrigate your plants like the example below.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-small\">Einhell BG-SP 400 RB Rain-Barrel Pump</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200525907/Einhell-Rain-BG-SP-400-RB-Barrel-Pump-700c.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"212\" height=\"257\"></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Keep your courgettes and marrows well watered.</strong> If you’re are a pond person you may find weed is becoming a problem at this time of the year, and it’s amazing how much detritus and organic matter can end up clogging a pond; so make sure you clear your pond regularly to stop it stifling your precious water plants.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Any established hedges could do with maintenance with some trimming during the summer to make sure they stay compact, and the more formal the hedge the more need for trimming. For smaller hedges, a pair of good, sturdy but comfortable to use, <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue110\">hand-held hedge-trimmers</span> would be ideal; but for anything larger, you’ll want some powerful trimmers like the battery powered example below. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-small\">Greenworks G-MAX 40v Cordless Hedge Trimmer with Twist Handle</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/202565315/greenworks-g-max-40v-hedgetrimmer-22637t-m_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"348\" height=\"178\"></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">If you do use electric trimmers, do remember to protect your hands, and wear gloves and goggles!</span></p>"},{"id":201722923,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/201722923.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201722923-A-pictorial-guide-to-the-main-features-of-a-rear-engine-rider","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":7,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200262686,"created_at":"2014-02-13T17:30:26Z","updated_at":"2015-04-15T15:41:30Z","name":"A pictorial guide to the main features of a rear engine rider","title":"A pictorial guide to the main features of a rear engine rider","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2015-04-15T15:41:30Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<p>Here is a reasonably typical rear engine rider with some of the main features highlighted. </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200420176/827m.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"579\" height=\"428\"></p>"},{"id":201581153,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/201581153.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201581153-Lawn-mower-drive-systems","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":7,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200261416,"created_at":"2014-01-09T12:29:07Z","updated_at":"2015-04-22T14:59:38Z","name":"Lawn mower drive systems","title":"Lawn mower drive systems","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2015-04-22T14:59:38Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Unlike manual or push lawn mowers, self-propelled mowers<strong> </strong>have an engine or motor that provide forward and sometimes, reverse motion as well as driving the blades.  It is usually the rear wheels that are driven. A self-propelled mower is often denoted by an <strong>SP</strong> (or <strong>PD</strong>)in the title. Within the self-propelled category there are a number of different types of geared and gearless drive systems. </span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Single Speed - </strong>A simple type of drive system with one forward speed only, and probably the most common type. The speed is usually set at fairly a comfortable walking pace (3-4 MPH approx’). You can , to a very limited extent, control speed with the throttle but this is not the main function of the single speed drive.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Variable Speed - </strong>This is a system that uses a drive pulley system that allows variable speed without gear changing. Basically it works by slipping the drive belt on pulleys. This type of drive is useful and versatile when you are dealing with variable terrain and inclines. This is usually controlled by a switch or lever on the handlebar. Variable drives are sometimes known by other names, often trade names like  <strong>Shift-On-The-Go.</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Hydrostatic  - </strong>This type of drive converts the power of the engine into hydraulic power using a pump-motor. Again it is a gearless operation, which means you can adjust the speed of the mower infinitely to allow delicate acceleration and enable better coverage and control.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">A dual hydrostatic drive system</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><em><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-small\">-</span></em><img class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" style=\"font-size: small;\" src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200640347/DualHydrostaticDriveSystemco2382_tcz_hydrostatic_drive.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"347\" height=\"222\"></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><em style=\"font-size: 11px;\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-small\"> </span></em></p>"},{"id":201383733,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/201383733.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201383733-What-are-the-advantages-of-a-non-submersible-pump-","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":7,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200311153,"created_at":"2014-01-06T14:39:14Z","updated_at":"2014-04-23T15:22:07Z","name":"What are the advantages of a non-submersible pump?","title":"What are the advantages of a non-submersible pump?","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2014-01-06T14:39:14Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<div>Non-submersible pumps can be petrol driven, do not have to waterproofed and therefore will generally be more powerful, and can pump more water and do it more economically. <br>\n</div><div><br></div><div>If a problem occurs the pumps are not underwater and can be accessed more easily. </div><div><br></div><div>Because they are not a tight and sealed unit they are easier to maintain.</div><div><br></div><div>Some are self-primed.</div><div><br></div>"},{"id":201383453,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/201383453.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201383453-What-sort-of-capacities-do-salt-spreaders-have-","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":7,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200300456,"created_at":"2014-01-06T12:51:02Z","updated_at":"2014-04-23T15:22:07Z","name":"What sort of capacities do salt spreaders have?","title":"What sort of capacities do salt spreaders have?","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2014-01-06T12:52:31Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<div>Obviously the sizes of hoppers vary greatly, but a typical entry level push type salt spreader will have a capacity of around 22kg moving up to perhaps 60kg or more on larger models. <br>\n</div><div><br></div><div>On tow behind models there is similar variation, with smaller models holding perhaps 39kg moving up to large tow behind salt spreaders with capacities of around 80kg or even more. * </div><div><br></div><div>* <i>Large industrial tow behind salt spreaders can, of course, have even larger hopper capacities of several hundred kilograms.</i>\n</div><div><br></div>"},{"id":201104448,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/201104448.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201104448-How-does-a-pressure-washer-work-","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":7,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200310953,"created_at":"2013-12-31T13:36:40Z","updated_at":"2014-04-23T15:20:33Z","name":"How does a pressure washer work?","title":"How does a pressure washer work?","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2014-01-30T13:38:59Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<div> </div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200378426/ryobi-rpw100s-pressure-washer-100-bar-1400-watt-240-volt_a.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"361\" height=\"207\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"> </div>\r\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">Basically a pressure washer boosts the pressure coming from you water supply.</div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>You attach a garden hose to the tap and then attach the other end to the inflow of the pressure washer.</div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>The urban supply pressure in the UK, is approximately 4-5 bar of pressure.

However, our aim is to ensure that you get smooth and efficient mowing from your new purchase and that you feel confident every time you switch it on. We hope you will find these tips useful.</p>\n<p>1. <strong>Assembly</strong>: Your new mower will arrive ‘boxed' and there is a minimal element of assembly. This is usually limited to attaching the 'Handlebars' and 'Grass catcher' .</p>\n<p>2. <strong>Preparation</strong>: Before you start mowing, check your lawn is clear of obstacles. Children’s toys, large sticks and similar. You would be amazed how many calls we get regarding a mower that has given up half-way across the lawn only to find out it was caused by an old dinky car lurking in the long grass!</p>\n<p>3. <strong>Starting</strong>: If you are have difficulty starting your machine, it is always advisable to check the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check your plug and socket to see if the cable is secure. Make sure it has not come loose, or been yanked out so your kids can charge the tablet. Also, make sure the cable is not kinked and has not become tangled or caught on foliage before you start.</li>\n<li>Ensure you are holding in the 'OPC Bar' (Operator Presence Control). If you are not holding this in you will be unable to pull out the recoil.</li>\n<li>If you have purchased a hover mower, make sure you tilt it slightly back on starting, allowing the the air to circulate under the cutting deck and give it lift.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br>4. <strong>Storage</strong>: Make sure you store your electric mower in a dry place, covered if possible. Always give it a wipe over before storage and never store the mower away with grass or mud left on it (see below)</p>\n<p>5. <strong>Performance</strong>: If you are having trouble collecting grass or you think the mower is not cutting properly, here are some things to consider.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don’t try to cut very wet grass that as this will result in clogging and poor performance<br>If you have purchased a hover mower, don’t forget that a percentage of clippings, the finer ones, are recycled onto the lawn and that, due to air flow, some clippings wil be blown away from the mower.</li>\n<li>If you have a hover with a collecting box, you should walk inas traight line for the best collection.</li>\n<li>If your mower cuts out and you are using an extension chord, check that it the extension is rated high enough for your lawnmower</li>\n<li>Check the cutting height is set correctly. If you are having trouble with the cutting and the mower feels sluggish, this could well be the problem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br>6. <strong>Grass and Mud</strong>: Wet and rotting grass causes metal components to rust and grass and dirt in or around the blades can cause all sorts of problems. Always make sure you clean the cutting deck regularly and thoroughly.</p>\n<p>If your mower does not have a 'Deck Wash Port' (an attachment for a hose) you will need to tip the machine to clear the deck from beneath. It is best to tip from front to back so that the machine pivots/rests on the back wheels.</p>\n<p>7. <strong>Servicing</strong>: Don’t forget that Annual Servicing is recommended by the manufacturers and is a requirement if you want to extend the guarantee beyond the first year.</p>\n<p>And finally, we’d like to thank you for your custom. Hopefully these tips and guidelines will help you enjoy your new mower and get trouble free and satisfactory operation from it.

It can be used to create kindling.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> <strong>Maintenance</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Fuel:</strong> Modern fuel contains ethanol, which absorbs moisture and causes the fuel to deteriorate in as little as 30 days, causing damage and starting issues if left in the tank. Our suggested solution is either to drain the tank if are going to leave it for a while, e.g. storage in the off-season. When you <em>are</em> using it, we recommend adding fuel stabilising additive to all fuel before filling up your tank.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Oil </strong>: Regular oil changes protect your engine damage and excessive wear make sure you refer to your ‘Engine’ manual regarding schedules for regular oil changes.</p>\n<p><strong>Servicing</strong>: Don’t forget that Annual Servicing is a recommended by the manufacturers and is a requirement if you want to extend the guarantee beyond the first year. Make sure you speak to your dealer about this, as, for example, an out of tune engine can result in reduced performance.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong><strong>Health &amp; Safety</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is advisable to wear safety goggles when using your log splitter to avoid potential injury from flying splinters. A pair of heavy work boots is also advisable.</li>\n<li>Make sure you place your log splitter on a steady and solid surface before using.</li>\n<li>Keep any other persons a good distance away while you are operating the splitter.</li>\n<li>Make sure you keep your hands clear of the machine during operation and always use the hand guards where fitted.</li>\n<li>Keep hands clear of cracks in logs as these are often unstable and can close on your fingers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> Finally, we hope you enjoy, or continue to enjoy, using your log splitter and if you have problems or issues we haven't covered, don’t hesitate to contact us on… <a href=\"mailto:technicalsupport@mowdirect.co.uk\">technicalsupport@mowdirect.co.uk</a> or leave a comment at the end of this page.  </p>\n<p><em> </em></p>"},{"id":201442836,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/201442836.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201442836-Does-mulching-leave-grass-on-the-lawn-","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":18,"vote_sum":1,"vote_count":1,"section_id":200262686,"created_at":"2014-02-07T14:12:21Z","updated_at":"2022-04-06T15:33:34Z","name":"Does mulching leave grass on the lawn?","title":"Does mulching leave grass on the lawn?","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2015-04-15T15:45:31Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Well of course, the short answer is \"Yes.

They are kept in the body of the deck, sometimes with the help of deflectors, and cut several times, reducing them to tiny clippings.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">In dedicated mulching decks, this is done by specially shaped blades.

You are going to be holding them, controlling the mower through them and trying to store the mower despite them for some years, so it pays to know what your options are.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Most lawn mowers have what looks like a simple single bar that is a rounded oblong running right  from one side of the mower up and across the operator position and down to the other side of the mower <em>(Fig A.</em>) Usually this bar is actually in two or more pieces, particularly if the handlebar is foldable (<em>Fig B</em>)</span></p>\r\n<p><em>Fig A.</em><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200326366/straight_handle.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"246\" height=\"155\"><em>Fig B.</em>   <img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200341606/2_part_handle.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Within this simple structure there are many possible variations on Control, Comfort and Convenience. So here are some thoughts on the 3cs. </span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Control</strong> - The handlebars are where you will, ultimately, control your mower, so think about switch, throttle and lever placement when you looking for a new mower.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Some bars are fitted with ‘bail arms’ that pull in to control the cut, some have switches and throttles. It is worth looking at where these are placed and how easy they are to reach. Look at the shape of the handle.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Some are just a straight across bar (<em>see fig 1</em>.) but some are curved up and over, making them easier to control and more comfortable (<em>see fig 2)</em> </span></p>\r\n<p>fig 1.<img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200411687/straight_handle_image.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"175\" height=\"161\">    fig 2.<img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200411717/curved_handlebar.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Comfort</strong> - If you are using a powerful mower for long periods of time, some comfort in the handle is probably going to be important so do consider this when buying. Some budget entry level machines have no grips, just the bar.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">As you move up through the models, some handlebars come with moulded plastic grips and some with softer comfort grips, often a ‘spongy’ rubber sleeve to make holding more comfortable and to reduce the effects of vibration.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Some higher spec’ models will even have anti-vibration material built into the handlebars.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Ergonomics have been growing in importance in recent years so the design and shape of the handle bars is gradually changing and many manufacturers are looking at radical ideas and handle shapes to make the mowing experience even more comfortable (<em>see images below).</em></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">   <img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200372768/Greenworks_handle.jpg\" alt=\"\">    <img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200441693/bosch-rotak-37-ergoflex-electric-4-wheel-roller-lawn-mower-600c.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"156\" height=\"145\">    <img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200325916/ErgonomicLoopHandleDesignLoop_Handle.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"165\" height=\"141\"></span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Many mowers, particularly the higher spec’ models  will now have height adjustable handlebars so you can work at a comfortable and back-strain reducing height. This is well worth looking out for.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Convenience</strong> - Storage is often an issue with mowers and if and how your mower’s handlebars fold might be a make or break feature if you have a finite space to store them in.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Some handlebars fold straight down, right over the engine/motor for basic storage.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Some are collapsible – that is, they will fold in half before folding over the mower’s deck, for more compact storage. This is often carried out with simple, twistable knobs on the side of the handles.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">As you move up through the models and ranges you will often find the folding action is carried out with quick release handles or levers. This is a good feature, worth looking out for and can save time and effort.</span></p>"},{"id":201374133,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/201374133.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201374133-Is-there-a-collection-box-included-on-electric-garden-chippers-or-shredders-","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":18,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200263016,"created_at":"2013-12-31T11:34:34Z","updated_at":"2015-04-16T14:43:24Z","name":"Is there a collection box included on electric garden chippers or shredders?

Congratulations, you are now in possession of groundbreaking technology that will make working in your garden easier cleaner, less hassle, with advanced, lighter, more powerful battery tools than ever before. </p>\n<p>We are keen that you get the very best performance from your battery powered lawn mower from the very first time you ‘charge-up and go’. Subsequently, we hope the following guidelines and advice will help. They are based on our extensive experience, with reference to the sorts of questions new cordless lawnmower mower users regularly ask us.</p>\n<p>As a preliminary tip, do read your manuals and instruction sheets thoroughly before you start and keep them to hand while you get used to your machine. They will offer you advice you may well need.<strong><em> </em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Assembly</strong>: Your new battery powered leaf blower will arrive ‘boxed' and there may be a minimal element of assembly.</p>\n<p><strong>Preparation</strong>: Before you use your leaf blower for the first time </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure you get used to the weight of your trimmer. Put the battery in and try lifting and wielding it without being switched on to get used to it. </li>\n<li>Check any your bolts/nuts/screws are tight before using</li>\n<li>Check battery contacts and the fit</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Starting</strong>: If you are have difficulty starting your cordless leaf blower, it is always advisable to check the following</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure your battery or batteries are correctly charged as per the instructions in the manual.</li>\n<li>Check the battery or batteries to see if they are fitted properly and securely in place.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Storage:</strong> Storing your blower in the right place is important but there are extra considerations when storing a battery powered model</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure you store your cordless blower in a dry place, covered if possible. Always give it a wipe-over before storage and never store the blower wet leaves or moisture left on it. Never leave or attempt to store it in a humid environment.</li>\n<li>Before storing your cordless blower away for a long time, make sure the battery is partially charged, perhaps somewhere between 30 and 70% depending on the time they are being stored. Storing on a full charge can reduce the battery life and storing on no charge can make re-charging later potentially difficult.</li>\n<li>It is preferable to store your battery separate from the blower itself, but in similar conditions</li>\n<li>Try to make sure you store your battery or batteries at a reasonable temperature, not in any extremes of hot and cold as this can also affect the charging cycles and battery life, make sure you don’t store them near or on boilers or radiators and avoid leaving them in a hot car or by a window in the sun.</li>\n<li>Try to ensure that batteries are not stored in such a way that metal can touch the contacts as this can damage them and is, potentially, dangerous. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Health and Safety</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Never point your blower at people or animals and be careful in general where you point the powerful air jet as twigs and other debris can fly up and could cause harm or damage</li>\n<li>Do wear a pair of goggles during use to protect your eyes from flying debris and dust</li>\n<li>Battery powered leaf blowers are relatively quiet but we do recommend a pair of ear defenders during use.</li>\n<li>Never use your leaf blower when over-tired, ill or under the influence of alcohol</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Servicing</strong>: Don’t forget that Annual Servicing is usually recommended by the manufacturers and is a requirement if you want to extend the guarantee beyond the first year.</p>\n<p>Finally, thank you very much for your custom.

Invest in the future with Redback </p>\n<p><strong>Batteries: </strong>Lithium-ion batteries are very advanced and will offer plenty of power, power even equivalent to petrol in some cases. With some TLC they will last you and offer you optimum  performance. Here's a few ways to look after them. </p>\n<ol>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Your batteries should be kept at room temperature, whenever possible (storage for example) around the 20°C mark. Extremes of heat can age your Li-Ion batteries and cut down on their effectiveness and longevity. So be sure not to store them near hot radiators, on boilers, in airing cupboards and don't leave them in a hot car or by a window in strong sunshine. </span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Don't store your batteries in a humid environment as condensation could damage them. </span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Try not to run your battery to its absolute discharge before you charge again. A lithium-ion battery will operate at its best if it is partially discharged and re-charged on a regular basis, rather than waiting until the battery runs out. In fact, try not to completely discharge lithium-ion batteries at all if possible, as they can be hard to start up again with a regular charger.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Lithium-ion batteries can be stored and re-used with minimal, in fact negligible, discharge, so they will have pretty much the same power in them when you pick them up weeks, even months, after use. However, for the best results - when you store your batteries, for long periods, perhaps over the winter - try to make sure they are stored charged at around 40% as this will ensure the maximum power return. Don’t charge them for long periods when empty or fully charged.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">For safety, when storing, try to make sure the batteries do not make contact with metal - a metal shelf for example - as the batteries can seriously over heat if the terminals rest on metal. </span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Keep the contacts clean and free of both moisture and anything that might reduce the connection. </span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Chainsaws:</span></strong></p>\n<p> </p>"},{"id":201377503,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/201377503.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201377503-What-makes-a-good-garden-tool-","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":20,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200267713,"created_at":"2014-01-02T16:28:00Z","updated_at":"2014-04-23T15:22:06Z","name":"What makes a good garden tool?","title":"What makes a good garden tool?","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2014-01-02T16:28:00Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<div>A good Garden Tool should be strong, hardwearing and well balanced with a comfortable grip, a durable head and it should be built to last. <br>\n</div><div><br></div><div>There are individual features and characteristics you would expect from Garden Tools</div><div><br></div><div>\n<b>Garden Spade</b> –  should have a rugged stainless steel head and a strong and long lasting shaft, either water proof polypropylene or polished, splinter-proof hardwood and a comfortable D-Grip of a good size, either polypropylene or metal and wood. <br>\n</div><div><br></div><div>Included in this category is the <b>Border Spade</b>–  look for similar rugged construction as the Garden Spade but a narrower, smaller blade, suitable for tight spacers, border maintenance and edging</div><div><br></div><div>\n<b>Garden Fork </b>– ought to have  four strong, well-spaced tines and, similar to the Garden Spade, a strong and durable Polypropylene or hardwood shaft and handle. <br>\n</div><div><br></div><div>Included in this category is the <b>Border Fork</b>.

Make sure you speak to your dealer about this, as, for example, an out of tune engine can result in reduced performance.<strong> </strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Cleaning </strong>Give your Snow Blower a good wipe down when you have finished. This will avoid puddles and means there will be less chance of rust.

Be sure you take regular breaks and if you have any on-going conditions such as heart disease, blood pressure issues or diabetes you should consult a medical professional before using your machine.</li>\n<li>Remember your blower could pick up stones and gravel or other detritus so never aim your chute at people, animals, or property.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Never try to clear blockages in your Snow Blower with your hands (or feet)! </strong>Always make sure the machine is switched off, spark plug disconnected, and use a plastic cleaning tool (there may be one provided with your model) or a wooden tool or broom handle.

Think about a decent quality helmet, like a chainsaw helmet, which will have a visor to protect you from flying chips, and built in ear-muffs/defender. Strong gardening or working type trousers and jackets can protect you from brambles and other foliage scratches and stings.</li>\r\n<li>\n<strong>Don’t</strong> ever put your hand inside the feeding neck or chute, or in fact any part of the machine, when the shredder is on.  Although most are designed so you cannot get your hands near the cutting or chipping mechanism, it is always advisable to be cautious when dealing with powered machinery. If there is a blockage, if something becomes jammed, use the reverse function if your machine has one. If it does not, you could use a larger branch to push the stuck item through. Otherwise TURN IT OFF OR DISCONNECT IT and let it cool before you do anything else. </li>\r\n<li>\n<strong>Do</strong> put branches through thick end first, that way the branch is less likely to move around and hit you or anyone else if there is a problem</li>\r\n<li>\n<strong>Do </strong>go through a basic safety checklist before you start.  E.g.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>    Check your machine’s stability.</li>\r\n<li>    If it has a brake or lock, make sure it is on</li>\r\n<li>    Make sure the emergency stop or safety stop is set if you have one</li>\r\n<li>    Make sure any outlet chute is aimed in a safe direction, and cannot spray wood chips at humans, pets or delicate plants</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div>      6. <strong>Don't</strong> ignore the manual and make sure you know your particular machine’s capabilities and quirks </div>\r\n<div> </div>"},{"id":201159617,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/201159617.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201159617-Some-general-tips-on-looking-after-your-chipper-or-shredder-","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":0,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200296826,"created_at":"2013-12-31T12:18:34Z","updated_at":"2015-04-21T14:55:51Z","name":"Some general tips on looking after your chipper or shredder ","title":"Some general tips on looking after your chipper or shredder ","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2015-04-21T14:55:51Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<div class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"> <img style=\"font-size: 11px;\" src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200538258/APACHE_BIO555_PETROL_CHIPPER_SHREDDER_370W.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"244\" height=\"285\">\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-small\"><em> </em></span></div>\r\n<div>•  Try to keep your chipper or shredder clean, make sure the mechanism is not clogged up, in particular, with damp or wet material. This will improve the machine's efficiency and give it a longer life</div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>•  Check that the waste you wish to chip or shred is free of stones or rocks. This is especially important with piles of leaves, as it's easy to pick up an armful of leaves with small, but potentially damaging, stones lurking in it.</div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>•  Do see to it that the chip outlet or outlet chute is kept clear of any accumulating debris, this will help prevent overheating</div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>•  Try to make sure that no part of the branch, particularly knots and bumps, exceeds the machine’s stated cutting diameter, as this can damage the machine. The thickest part of the branch should always be within the parameters set by the manufacturer. <br><br>\n</div>\r\n<div>•  Generally you should avoid attempting to chip or shred seasoned wood or old wood as it can be very hard, especially for a smaller machine</div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>•  If your blades are replaceable, why not buy a spare set when you purchase your machine, so you won’t ever be out of cutting power in the middle of a job</div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>•  Try not to leave your machine  outside. A garden shredder or chipper will not respond well to being left in the rain.</div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>•  If you have a petrol machine, make sure you clean around the cap after a re-fill. With dirt, chips and so on flying around it can get grubby and any dirt or debris in your fuel will cause problems. </div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>•  Don’t feed branches or material in too fast, and let the machine ‘digest’ what it is dealing with before you load another lot in. This will reduce the chance of jamming and clogging.</div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>\n<strong>Engineer’s Tip</strong> – <em>Let the engine warm up for a bit before you start trying to chip branches. It takes a lot of energy to chip or shred a branch and you can reduce the wear and tear on your engine and mechanism by a great deal by simply holding back for a moment, reducing maintenance costs and/or the cost of a replacement. </em>\n</div>\r\n<div> </div>"},{"id":201104218,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/201104218.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201104218-What-is-the-maximum-diameter-for-branches-stems-etc-that-a-chipper-or-shredder-can-take-","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":0,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200281007,"created_at":"2013-12-31T11:53:35Z","updated_at":"2016-02-23T11:43:09Z","name":"What is the maximum diameter for branches stems, etc, that a chipper or shredder can take?","title":"What is the maximum diameter for branches stems, etc, that a chipper or shredder can take?","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2016-02-23T11:43:09Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<div>The maximum diameter of branches handled by individual chipper or shredders will be listed in the product manual and if you look through the product reviews each should list the maximum diameter to be handled by each machine.

front. </span></div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">This contra-rotation throws the soil forward so it is re-broken each time, creating a finer tilth, ideal for

effectively. </span></div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Some petrol rear tine tillers have tines that can in fact revolve both ways, offering the ultimate in

Many people buy lawn mowers without thinking it through, often buying the wrong type or size, or not carrying out basic maintenance all of which is tantamount to throwing your money into a big pit and setting fire to it. </span></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Certainly lawn mowers can, and do, go wrong from time to time, but experience tells us that a great many problems result from incorrect use, buying unsuitable machines, lack of preparation or simple maintenance. </span></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Of course, sometimes accidents happen, like running over your own cable, but a bit of thought and care can help avoid even this kind of thing.</span></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Whether it is on a week by week, or a season to season basis,  caring for your lawn mower is a vital part of ownership and means your machine will last longer and perform better. </span></div>\n<div><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"> </span></div>\n<div><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">What we want, here at MowDirect, is for you to avoid the hassle of having to call your supplier and return your mower, meaning you are without it, only to find out it would have been easy to avoid or fix in the first place.  </span></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">So remember...</span></div>\n<ol>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Read your manual carefully. Keep it nearby for reference. Many manuals are printed in several languages so, to save time, why not bookmark the english pages you will need. Alternatively, take the english pages out and bind them separately.  </span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Check your machine regularly. Make sure all joints are kept oiled. Check the contacts on your battery, if the mower has one, check the oil and if you have an electric mower, check connections and cables.  </span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Don't leave it out in the rain. Store your mower in a dry, cool place at all times, especially over winter. </span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Clean your machine regularly, including the cutting deck. Remember organic debris can release moisture potentially corroding your mower. If your mower has a hose connection, rinse the deck after every cut. Make absolutely sure your machine is clean and dry before storing it for long periods.  </span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Make sure you keep the engine topped up with oil and fuel and NEVER leave the fuel in it over the winter or for more than a fortnight without fuel stabiliser as it can do damage to your engine. </span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Only ever use fresh, unleaded fuel</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Keep nuts and bolts lubricated, tight and clean during the season. </span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Keep the blades sharp, sharpen at the end, or beginning, of the season.  </span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Remove blockages when and if they occur. </span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Store your machine in a dry, sheltered place between uses and over the winter.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">If possible, cover your mower when not in use.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Do get your mower serviced regularly if possible. Many people forget to do this and then wonder why manufacturers will not honour their warranties. Inevitably, pretty much ALL warranties are dependent on a regular (yearly) service. </span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Simple care and basic maintenance will keep your machine going for longer and ensure it last season to season.  </span></p>\n<div><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">There are a number of more detailed articles in this section that deal with common lawnmower problems including  <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue110\"><strong>“<a href=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201786957--My-Mower-Won-t-Start-A-4-point-guide-to-basic-problems\">My mower won't start</a></strong><a href=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201786957--My-Mower-Won-t-Start-A-4-point-guide-to-basic-problems\">“</a></span> and <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue110\">“<a href=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201141006--My-mower-isn-t-cutting-properly-\"><strong>My mower isn’t cutting properly</strong>”</a></span><a href=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201141006--My-mower-isn-t-cutting-properly-\"> </a></span></div>"},{"id":201069968,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/201069968.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201069968--I-ran-over-the-cable-","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":0,"vote_sum":1,"vote_count":1,"section_id":200271368,"created_at":"2013-12-17T17:04:57Z","updated_at":"2017-07-18T14:21:24Z","name":"“I ran over the cable”","title":"“I ran over the cable”","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2017-07-18T14:21:24Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<div class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200705533/Fotolia_49287156_XS.jpg\" alt=\"\"></span></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">This is very common and can be disastrous.

You could try buying a model with a cable tidy, this will both prevent stretching and snagging and keep the cable from under your blades. </span><br><br><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Perhaps, in the long run, you should think about a cordless electric or petrol driven model, particularly if you have a larger area to mow and lots of hazards to tangle your cable up. Borders and trees may not be the main reason for running over your own cable, but the freedom from the cable means that’s one less thing to think about when you are negotiating your prize begonia bed or a sleeping dog on the lawn. </span>\n</div>\n<div> </div>"},{"id":201324173,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/201324173.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201324173-What-is-a-cement-mixer-","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":0,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200267713,"created_at":"2013-12-17T15:28:11Z","updated_at":"2015-04-17T11:46:24Z","name":"What is a cement mixer?","title":"What is a cement mixer?","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2015-04-17T11:46:24Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<div><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">A cement mixer is a machine which uses a revolving drum to create an aggregate called cement.</span></div>\r\n<div><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"> </span></div>\r\n<div><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">This is made by mixing sand or gravel and water, the molecules of which join to create a hardening material called concrete or cement for foundations, walls and other building tasks.

For example, when a lawn has become compacted from heavy use or because the soil is dense and clay-like, this means the air and water cannot circulate properly and can lead to brown spots or an unhealthy looking lawn.<br> <br>Also, some lawns are on slopes, meaning they lose some of the water they should get from the rain or from watering. On these circumstances, aerating helps more water penetrate the lawn. </div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Aerating can be carried out by means of a rake or a garden fork, but this work is time consuming and laborious and can create or exacerbate physical problems such as back strain. Added to this it can be inefficient unless you are meticulous about your coverage of the lawn. The alternatives are easy to use and efficient mechanical aerators. <br> <br>There are a number of different types of aerator, they can be propelled by hand, powered by petrol or mains electricity and, increasingly, Lithium-ion batteries.<br> <br>There are two major styles or types.</div>\n<div>\n<br>1. <strong>Solid Tine Aerators</strong><br><strong>2.

Battery powered, mains electric or petrol, whichever you decide on, or own, keep it in good condition. A well-maintained machine is a safer machine. A good all round hedgetrimmer should have double-sided, reciprocating blades, a decent cutting length and, for more comfort and convenience, a swivel handle with several positions to make cutting at different angles easier.</li>\n<li>Always read the manual. This is a constant comment from suppliers because people often do damage to machines simply because they didn't read some simple instructions. if the manual does not read well and you have queries, use the internet to check for answers, call the manufacturer, or call us!<strong>*</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Never use a hedgetrimmer without checking it first. keep your blades sharp and clean and lubricate them. Blunt blades make the job harder and can do damage to your hedge or shrub.  </li>\n<li>Make sure you wear sensible clothing. Never cut in flip-flops and loose clothing. Wear flat, sturdy shoes and clothes that cannot become entangled with the blades of the hedgetrimmer.</li>\n<li>Wear protective clothing if you can. It may seem like overkill to wear goggles while trimming a hedge but if you are hit in your eye by a flying twig you could damage your eyesight. Do also wear robust gardening or chainsaw gloves wherever possible. </li>\n<li>Always check for obstacles like toys, branches, rocks, etc in the grass around your hedge before you start. If you trip while cutting it could be very dangerous </li>\n<li>Never use a hedgetrimmer in wet weather. it is dangerous, particularly if you are using a mains electric powered machine. It is also not effective and will not produce good results. </li>\n<li>Don't drink alcohol or any mind-altering substances before, or during, hedgetrimming. You really need to be fit, alert and in control of your senses and your muscles to carry out <em>a </em>task like this. Likewise, don't do this job when you are overtired. </li>\n<li>If you are using a mains electric hedgetrimmer, it often helps to have the cable back and over your shoulder so it cannot get anywhere near the blades. </li>\n<li>Ensure your hands are always on both handles when using your hedgecutter</li>\n<li>Your standard, generic all-round hedgetrimmer is not designed to do the tops of trees or very tall hedges. You must NEVER overstretch or stand on tip-toes to cut high twigs and branches. In fact, as a rule, your hedgetrimmer should never be raised above head height. If you decide to use a ladder or step-ladder PLEASE make sure it is stable. Ultimately the best way is to keep your feet flat on the floor and if the hedge is too high, use a long-range hedgetrimmer. </li>\n<li>Each cut should be done with a long, carefully controlled sweeping movement, parallel to and across the top of the hedge. the side should be cut with the same sort of movement from the bottom to the top of the hedge. </li>\n<li>Always move forwards along the hedge when cutting. Walking backwards along a hedge with a powered machine is not a good idea. </li>\n<li>If foliage becomes stuck in your blades ALWAYS make sure the machine is totally powered down before removing and ALWAYS wear gloves! </li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>*</strong> MowDirect has a comprehensive range of well-priced, quality hedgecutters available.

(<em>see fig 2.</em>)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>                           <em>Fig 2</em>.<img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200423967/Allett_Cylinder_Mowers_diagram.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"281\" height=\"289\"></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Within these two cutting styles there are four main categories.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Wheeled Rotary Mowers </strong> - these four-wheeled mowers are popular, versatile and the most commonly purchased mower.  Great all-rounders, they come in a huge variety of sizes styles, drives, cutting facilities and features. They work in all sorts of garden and terrain. Their coverage ranges from small to large gardens.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Roller Rotary Mowers  </strong>-  like<strong> </strong>the wheeled rotary, above, they are popular and have all the same benefits plus the added advantage of a rear roller to achieve the striped effect that gardeners, particularly in the UK, are so fond of. They give a good, even cut and all garden sizes are pretty much catered for.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Hover Mowers   - </strong>these<strong> </strong>have a rotary action, but hover on a cushion of air so there are no wheels required for mowing. However, transport wheels are occasionally provided. These mowers generally have a lower footprint than other mowers and are relatively lightweight so are easy to store. They are ideal for small to medium sized gardens</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Cylinder Mowers - </strong>these are nearly always fitted with a stripe-creating roller. Invented first and very traditional they come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes and the very top models are used for large, prestigious gardens and sports facilities.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"> Of course within all these categories there are many sub-divisions and choices of power, style, size and cutting width.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">These are all dealt with in separate articles in this Buying Guide section.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"> </span></p>"},{"id":201186573,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/201186573.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201186573-Sample-agent-guidelines","author_id":290886932,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":0,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200265823,"created_at":"2013-11-27T15:50:24Z","updated_at":"2014-04-23T15:20:57Z","name":"Sample agent guidelines","title":"Sample agent guidelines","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2013-11-27T15:50:24Z","user_segment_id":511203,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<p>These are guidelines that this section might contain to help agents solve tickets.

That way you can be sure to get the best out of your new ride-on and use it with confidence every time.</p>\n<p><strong>Fuel:</strong> Ride-On fuel tanks, unlike those in cars, buses and so on, are not sealed. That means fuel will evaporate over time. Modern fuel contains ethanol, which absorbs moisture and causes the fuel to deteriorate in as little as 30 days, causing damage and starting issues if left in the tank. So either drain the tank if are going to leave it for a while or, our recommended solution, add fuel stabilising additive to any fuel you leave in the tank. </p>\n<p><strong>Storage:</strong> Ride-On Tractor engines are not waterproof. So make sure you store yours in a dry place, covered if possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Oil Servicing</strong>: Regular oil changes protect your engine damage and excessive wear make sure you refer to your ‘Engine’ manual regarding schedules for regular oil changes.</p>\n<p><strong>Battery</strong>: If your machine comes with a battery charger, it is highly recommended that you check your battery manual to check how often you should charge. This will help you get maximum life from the battery.</p>\n<p><strong>Grass Collector</strong>: If your machine has a dedicated grass collector, there is a safety switch that won’t allow the blades to engage unless the collector is fixed firmly on, so nothing can get near the blades when moving. If your blades do not engage, or your machine won’t start or cuts out when you try, this is the first thing you should check. This accounts for a massive 90% of reported problems with non-starting or engines cutting out.</p>\n<p><strong>Slopes</strong>: Most Ride-On Tractors will only work when used at a maximum of 15 degrees tilt. Check your manual to see if this applies to yours, as there are exceptions.</p>\n<p><strong>N.B.</strong> Our top tip on when cutting on slopes is to always cut across the slope, <em>not</em> up and down.</p>\n<p><strong>Uneven Ground</strong>: You should always cut at a higher height setting and at the slowest speed setting on uneven ground.</p>\n<p><strong>Belts</strong>: Deck and Drive Belts are ‘wearing parts’ and can easily be overstressed and fail with incorrect use, so do make sure the machine is operated correctly when cutting to ensure they are not overloaded.</p>\n<p><strong>Grass and Mud: </strong> Wet and rotting grass causes metal components to rust and grass and dirt in or around the engine will clog the cooling fins, causing overheating and damage. Always make sure you clean the underside of your machine regularly and thoroughly. This will help your tractor last longer with fewer problems.</p>\n<p><strong>Servicing</strong>: Don’t forget that Annual Servicing is recommended by the manufacturer and is a requirement if you want to extend the guarantee beyond the first year. Make sure you speak to your dealer about this, as out of tune engines and blunt blades can result in poor cutting, poor collection, and environmental pollution.</p>\n<p>Finally, we sincerely hope you enjoy using your Ride-On Tractor and if you have problems not covered by these notes or the handy information sheet that will arrive with your tractor, don’t hesitate to contact us at <a href=\"mailto:technicalsupport@mowdirect.co.uk\">technicalsupport@mowdirect.co.uk<em> </em></a></p>"},{"id":208997986,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/208997986.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/208997986-Oleo-Mac-chainsaws-what-s-in-a-brand-name-","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":1,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":202062163,"created_at":"2016-05-26T11:31:03Z","updated_at":"2016-06-03T13:56:09Z","name":"Oleo-Mac chainsaws - what’s in a brand name?

They tested six top-name chainsaws in several categories including semi-professional, professional and hobby.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">These machines were from Oleo-Mac, Stihl, Husqvarna, Jonsered and McCulloch. After  a series of tough tests the final results were potentially surprising to some critics. In the professional category, the <strong>Oleo-Mac CS650</strong> <em>(see below)</em> was deemed to be the best value in the group, with power, performance, easy-starting, the right features customers look for in a contemporary saw and a price that was over a hundred Euros below some of the others.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">In fact, across the board in comparison, the Oleo-Mac saws hold up their end in both value, feature and performance terms. This clearly confirms Oleo-Mac’s place up there with the perceived big-boys of powered garden machinery.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/oleo-mac-gs-650-petrol-chainsaw.html\"><strong>OLEO-MAC CS650 </strong></a></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Plenty of bar, great value and all the features you want</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/oleo-mac-gs-650-petrol-chainsaw.html\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/204033926/gs650_MowHow_IMage_Edit.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"391\" height=\"194\"></a></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><strong>Biggest is Not Necessarily Best</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">And yet, if you ask many people what’s the best chainsaw, they will often go straight to the German or Swedish brands. This is a common phenomenon in chainsaw brand comparison. I mean, a chainsaw from a Mediterranean country like Italy couldn’t possibly be as good as one from the snowy, rough terrains of northern European or Scandinavian countries could they? The answer is yes, of course they could. Italian engineering, when it comes to powered machinery, is up there with the best. If you have to farm in the Italian alps, the rugged Tyrol or on the terraced slopes of the Amalfi coast, you would know you need tough, reliable equipment.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Myths are often built up about big brands but, in fact, in terms of build quality, performance and features, Oleo-Mac chainsaws frequently out perform their competitors and nearly always beat them hands-down on price. The biggest, most famous brand is not necessarily the best brand in the same way that the person who shouts loudest is not necessarily right. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/204385603/Chainsaw_MowHow_Image_2016-06-03_at_13.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"387\" height=\"284\"></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"> An Oleo-Mac chainsaw in action</p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><strong>Perceptions Will Change</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Building a brand is almost always a long and painstaking process involving careful quality control of your products, making sure your marketing strategy is right, ensuring the customer becomes fond of, and loyal to, your products, your ethos and your company. But ultimately you need products that work well, compete with their rivals and that customers want. Over and over Oleo-Mac are proving this.  If you offer value and quality at competitive prices people will slowly change their habits. This is happening right now, changing the perceptions of potential customers.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">If you’ve not tried an Oleo-Mac Chainsaw, brushcutter or one of their their stylish sleek and heavy-duty mowers, now is the time. <a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/oleo-mac\">MowDirect is the exclusive supplier in the UK</a> at the moment and can offer very good deals.

This speeds up these important tasks but, as ever, all processes are carried out under the watchful eye of human experts.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">4. <strong>British Mowers</strong> at their best are developed using a tradition of design, old valued skills and carefully controlled manufacture. Many of Hayter's signature mowers are still made in Spellbrook, Hertfordshire, the tiny village that was Douglas Hayter's home and workplace, where the Hayter mower was born, and that still hums with the manufacture of traditional British Racing Green mowers, many fitted with the rear roller that creates that most British of garden features - the striped lawn.  </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">5.<strong> Excellence </strong>in mowers comes with a price-tag. However, Quality items are worth the money, outlasting cheaper, less well put together products so the saving is ultimately in buying well to start with. Hayter's claim to quality is pretty much unassailable and Hayter mower owners are vocal in their praise and admiration. This covers reliability, build-quality and cutting performance, creating great lawn finishes across the UK. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">6. <strong>Heritage </strong>is an important part of creating and sustaining any long-running and and popular brand, and Hayter's goes back through 65 years of innovation, attention to detail, style, build quality and customer satisfaction. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">7. <strong>Quality Control </strong>is another important step in the manufacturing process and something Hayter takes very seriously, watching and testing at all stages of the process and maintaining the <strong>BS EN 9001:2000 </strong>quality standard.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">8. <strong>Hand Assembly</strong> is exactly what Hayter's customers want and all Hayter machines are put together in this time honoured and traditional way. This means any issues are spotted early, with no impact on you, the customer, and inspection is constant and consistent. </span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/204330003/Hayter_Hand_Assembly_MowHowScreen_Shot_2016-06-01_at_16.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"371\" height=\"282\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Hand Assembly At Spellbrook</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"> 9. <strong>Hard-wearing</strong> <strong>products </strong>need tough and long-lasting paintwork and Hayter's racing green livery needs to look good for as long as possible and needs to survive the daily knocks, chips and bangs that mowing can produce. Hayter's pre-treatment leads to quality adherence which helps the paint sit and stay longer and the paint used is of high quality and applied using again, a mixture of human experience and expertise and high-end technology. We know this because we've seen it done! </span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">10. <strong>Great Design</strong> takes great designers and Hayter's team are highly trained and use ultra-modern computer design programs hand-in-hand with regular and high-quality research and development testing. This makes the mowers as rugged, effective and high-performing as they look. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">So. That's just a few of the many reasons you should take a look at Hayter. As Hayter's slogan used to run 'Sooner or later, you'll buy a Hayter.'

When you buy a Hayter mower or scarifier, in fact any machine with the Hayter name, you buy into more than half a century of expertise, quality and prestige and you rightly expect this to be a long-term purchase, and that you now own a machine that will last and give you season after season of great performance. </p>\n<p>This is precisely what Hayter machines are built to do but, like any machine, there are certain things you have to do to keep this machine working at the top of its capabilities. Annual servicing is a vital part of the conditions governing your warranty and if the servicing schedule is adhered to, you will find your Hayter operates  as it should and gives you the cut, power and performance you would expect from such a brand. It also means you are properly covered if, as occasionally happens, something goes wrong.</p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><strong>Warranty</strong></span></p>\n<p>Here are the current warranty and service conditions for Hayter models.</p>\n<table style=\"height: 65px;\" width=\"489\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Range</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Domestic </strong></td>\n<td><strong>Commercial</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Conditions <br></strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Domestic lawn Mowers</td>\n<td>3 yrs</td>\n<td>90 Days</td>\n<td>Subject to Annual Service</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Harrier Range</td>\n<td>5yrs </td>\n<td>90 Days</td>\n<td>Subject to Annual Service</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Harrier Pro Range</td>\n<td>1yr</td>\n<td>1yr</td>\n<td>Annual Service Recommended</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Envoy  </td>\n<td>2yrs</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n<td>Annual Service Reccomended</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scarifier</td>\n<td>1yr</td>\n<td>90 Days</td>\n<td>Annual Service Recommended</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><strong>General Maintenance</strong> </span></p>\n<p>Regular maintenance by you will also help keep your machine at its optimum.

How large is your lawn? How fit and healthy are you? Do you have a flat lawn or are there slopes and humps and bumps?</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">For a flat, or even medium sized, lawn and for someone who is happy and fit enough to walk and push, a walk-behind, manually propelled mower is fine. In fact, if you are up to walking and pushing, some push mowers with a decent cutting width are fine even with large lawns. This even includes some battery powered mowers.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Manual or push lawn mowers are easy to manoeuvre, give you exercise and move at your own speed. However they may be a bit much if you have a large, several large, lawns to cut.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Self-Propelled mowers really come into their own with very large lawns and properties and areas of grass where there are slopes to deal with, usually negotiating inclines of up to 30 degrees with less effort.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">There are occasionally worries about self-propelled mowers and we sometimes deal with customers who fear the power driven mower will have a 'life of its own' and 'take-off' leaving them out of control.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">We can reassure you that that 'comic book' idea of a mower taking off and dragging you down the road can't happen. The drive is under your control. You engage it when you want it and you can turn it off to help manoeuvring the mower, when turning it for example.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">You can even get self-propelled lawn mowers that adjust to your walking pace.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Please click here if you would like to see our <a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/lawn-mowers\">extensive range of push of self-propelled mowers</a>.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>"},{"id":202384017,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/202384017.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/202384017-Powering-the-future-green-battery-technology","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":1,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200366463,"created_at":"2014-04-23T13:59:13Z","updated_at":"2017-10-19T14:59:52Z","name":"Powering the future - green battery technology","title":"Powering the future - green battery technology","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2017-10-19T14:59:52Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200711617/Fotolia_45859791_XS__1_.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"301\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Anyone who spends time maintaining their garden knows how frustrating it can be using old-style battery powered tools. Admittedly they are cleaner and quieter than petrol, are portable and ‘go-anywhere’ unlike mains electric powered tools, but up until recently their power has been fairly limited.</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Add to this the slow charging times, the ‘winding-down’ effect as the power dwindled and the fact that they lost all their power when stored and you can see why serious gardeners have traditionally been sceptical about utilising battery power. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Until now. A new generation of lightweight Lithium-ion (or Li-ion) batteries, has been changing the rules and challenging even the power of petrol. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Lithium (from the Greek for stone, ‘lithos’ ) is the lightest metal and the least dense solid element we know. This makes it ideal for use in batteries and keeps the weight of tools down. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">And that's not all. Modern Li-ion batteries </span><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">charge very fast, they do not lose power when stored and run for significantly longer with no ‘winding-down’ effect, just workable power from start to finish.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">So far so good. But they can't be that powerful surely? </span><span style=\"font-size: small;\">It is, after all, the overall power of petrol tools, particularly in the garden, that has given them the upper hand over the years.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Battery powered tools may be able to challenge electric mains powered tools but surely they can't challenge petrol?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Well, the answer is, yes they can. New batteries are being developed all the time, they get lighter and more powerful with each generation and some of the latest models are providing power equitable to that of petrol engines.

Subsequently you are trying to let light and air into the heart of the branch network, reducing mildew and assisting the ripening process.</span></li>\r\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong style=\"font-size: 11px;\">Use the right tools.</strong><span style=\"font-size: 11px;\"> You will need an efficient, sharp and decent quality pair of pruners or secateurs. These come in bypass style (where the blades pass each other for a neat cut) or anvil style (where the top blade presses down on the lower blade). For slightly thicker twigs, you may wish to purchase a pair of loppers or an electric or petrol pole saw, and for thick branches, if they need cutting back, you will probably need a manual pruning saw or powered pole pruners.</span></span></li>\r\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>What to prune.</strong> Thin out the branches in the middle of the tree network to open it up and remove any dead wood to avoid disease getting into the tree.

This is for safety purposes. Subsequently you will need to fill up before you start.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">6. <strong>Oil &amp; Fuel B:</strong> Only ever use fresh unleaded petrol in your machine. When it comes to oil, check the manual for instructions but our usual recommendation is to use SAE 30. </span><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Always check oil levels before you start!</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">7. <strong>Grass Collector: </strong>If you have bought a rear discharge and collect ride-on, make sure your grass collector is firmly attached.<strong> </strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">8<strong>. Weight &amp; Sensor: </strong>All ride-on mowers and lawn tractors are fitted with sensors under the seat. This is a safety measure, so the mower can't be started by, let's say, a child. Subsequently you must make sure you are sitting firmly on the seat or your ride-on may not start. NB: It has been known very occasionally, for a ride-on to stop when a bump has bounced someone out of their seat. Do not worry if this happens. Just sit ands start again.

Like January, this month can be cold, miserable and dark but on the plus side, it is slowly getting lighter and nature is just about starting to twitch a bit in bed and make those cute, snorty ‘I’m going to wake up soon noises’. So let’s think about getting ready.</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Weeding</strong><strong> and tidying. </strong>Tidy those beds and borders. Get rid of any further debris that has collected during January and double check that no weeds have crept under your carefully laid black polythene sheets and if there has been a lot of rain or a large amount of moisture, or it is getting warmer, there will be weeds skulking somewhere for sure. Make sure you get right into and under the roots.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Make sure you <strong>rake up any stray leaves</strong>, twigs and so on that are lying around on your plant or vegetable beds or lurking under bushes and shrubs.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">It might be a good idea to start <strong>popping some compost or manure on your soil</strong> at this time to help it to start really warming up, and you could use all your pruning detritus to make great compost or mulch using a <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue110\">good quality shredder<span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\"> <em>(see image below)</em></span> </span>to really break up those branches.</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-small\"><em>Bosch AXT-25-TC Electric Quiet Shredder</em></span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200428256/BOSCH_AXT_25_TC_ELECTRIC_GARDEN_SHREDDER_700H.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"239\" height=\"239\"></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Think about <strong>neatening up any plants and bushes</strong>, removing dead or old leaves and twigs with a pair of <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue110\">pruning shears or trimmers. </span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">You lawn fanatics could well be thinking about <strong>a bit of scarifying</strong> about now, and unless you have just recently laid your outdoor grass carpet, you could do worse. <strong>Remove those rogue leaves with a good scarifier</strong> like the CP1000V Electric Scarifier (<em>see image below</em>) However you do it, get in there and scratch that itch now.</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><em><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-small\">Wolf-Garten UV34E Electric Scarifier March</span></em></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200523577/WOLF_GARTEN_UV34E_ELECTRIC_SCARIFIER_700W.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"231\" height=\"231\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Believe it or not, late February is a decent time to start <strong>sowing a few things </strong>for early harvest. Aubergines, carrots, cauliflowers, celeriac and broad beans can all be planted now. Don’t forget, these seeds will need cover and protection and you should think about sowing in seed trays. The RHS says sheltered southern gardens can take broad beans directly into the soil, but in cold areas, you will need cloches or a fleece, so be as bold as your conditions allow. Brussels sprouts, however, can absolutely be planted outside now with a bit of frost protection, while you harvest the ones you planted earlier. Hardy little chaps brussels sprouts.</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">And finally, February is a good month to be <strong>doing some planning.</strong> Look at your planting plan for the coming year. What? Not got one? About time you did then. Are you keeping everything in the same place? Planting some new stuff? Think carefully now before everything starts to sprout of its own accord. So. Work done, sit down on your battered old deckchair or snazzy garden bench with a notebook, a pen, a cup of tea and start to plan and picture what the place will look like in a couple of months. But don’t sit for too long; you know it comes around fast!</span></p>"},{"id":201248786,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/201248786.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201248786-Words-of-power-a-glossary-of-generator-terms-phrases-and-acronyms","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":1,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200267713,"created_at":"2014-01-15T14:09:25Z","updated_at":"2015-04-17T11:46:57Z","name":"Words of power – a glossary of generator terms, phrases and acronyms","title":"Words of power – a glossary of generator terms, phrases and acronyms","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2015-04-17T11:46:57Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200711823/socket.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"75\" height=\"113\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200645436/inverter_generator_2000.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"134\" height=\"113\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200731677/wave2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"152\" height=\"113\"></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><em><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-small\"> </span></em></p>\r\n<p>When you are looking to purchase a generator you will come across a seemingly staggering amount of terminology, symbols and acronyms.

(Symbol = A) This is a measurement of electrical charge passing a single point in a circuit in a certain time (6.241×1018 electrons per second = one ampere)</p>\r\n<p><strong>AVR:</strong> Automatic Voltage Regulation. This is a method of controlling the fluctuations of a current in order to keep it constant, enabling the generator to power sensitive equipment like televisions, computers and monitors.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ATS: </strong>Automatic Transfer Switch. This is an electrical switch designed to swap a load between two sources.Some are manual, (you throw them yourself by hand) but others are automatic, clicking on when they sense a dip or rise in one of the sources. Subsequently they are often used (and highly recommended) to switch power to a generator when it is being used as a back up and the mains power fails.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Continuous Load</strong>: A load that the generator can maintain for an extended length of time with the engine at optimum efficiency</p>\r\n<p><strong>DC: </strong>Direct current. Current produced by batteries, solar cells and dynamos Hz Hertz. A unit of frequency defined as 1 cycle per second.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Inverter generator: </strong>A generator that uses microprocessor technology to condition the power, enabling the generator to that be lighter and smaller and run quieter and more efficiently. This is particularly useful in the small hobby, holiday and leisure style of generator.</p>\r\n<p><strong>kVA: </strong>Kilo Volt Amperes. This is an electrical measurement equivalent to 1000 watt amps kW Kilo Watts. A thousand watts of power.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Oil Alert: </strong>Honda trademark name for an oil shutdown system. This means if the oil level drops below a certain point, the engine shuts down preventing damage and saving money on costly repairs. Different manufacturers have different names for these systems, but many quality generators have low oil shutdown systems and it is a good feature to watch out for.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Parallel operation: </strong>The ability to link up two or more generators to provide double the rated output. </p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">Rated Power: </strong>This is a term for the maximum electric output a generator can provide continuously and safely under the manufacturers set conditions. The rated power is set by the manufacturer. Run time The length of time the generator will run on a full tank. :</p>\r\n<p><strong>NB</strong>: This is usually represented by manufacturers as run time on a 50% load so you will often have to halve the figure you are given</p>\r\n<p><strong>V:</strong> Volts. A volt is a measurement of electrical pressure </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p> </p>"},{"id":201201456,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/201201456.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201201456-How-do-water-pumps-work-","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":1,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200311153,"created_at":"2014-01-06T14:25:49Z","updated_at":"2015-04-17T11:35:41Z","name":"How do water pumps work?

However, our aim is to ensure that you get smooth and efficient mowing from your new purchase and that you feel confident every time you use it. We hope you will find these tips useful.</p>\n<p>1. <strong>Assembly</strong>: Your new mower will arrive ‘boxed' and there is a minimal element of assembly. This is usually limited to attaching the 'Handlebars' and 'Grass catcher' .</p>\n<p>2. <strong>Preparation</strong>: Before you start mowing, check your lawn is clear of obstacles. Children’s toys, large sticks, half-bricks and similar. Metal toys, stones etc can blunt your blades and reduce cutting efficiency.</p>\n<p>3. <strong>Storage</strong>: Make sure you store your mower in a dry place, covered if possible. Always give it a wipe over before storage and never store the mower away with grass or mud left on it (see below)</p>\n<p>4. <strong>Performance</strong>: If you are having trouble collecting grass or you think the mower is not cutting properly, here are some things to consider.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don’t try to cut very wet grass that as this will result in clogging and poor performance</li>\n<li>If you have adjustable cutting height, check this is set correctly. If you are having trouble with the cutting and the mower feels sluggish, this could well be the problem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>5. <strong>Grass and Mud</strong>: Wet and rotting grass causes metal components to rust and grass and dirt in or around the blades can cause all sorts of problems. Always make sure you clean the cutting deck regularly and thoroughly.  You will probably need to tip the machine back to clear the deck from beneath. </p>\n<p>6. <strong>Servicing</strong>: Don’t forget that Annual Servicing is recommended by the manufacturers and is a requirement if you want to extend the guarantee beyond the first year.</p>\n<p>And finally, we’d like to thank you for your custom. Hopefully these tips and guidelines will help you enjoy your new mower and get trouble free and satisfactory operation from it.

The Royal Horticultural Society advises that <strong>autumn is a good time to cultivate if you have clay soi</strong>l so think about this.

Everything that is except your parsnips, which do like a bit of frost to sweeten them.

We thought it would be useful to create a brief guide, a varied collection of tips and advice on safety, usage, fuel and maintenance, to save you time and help you to use your Petrol Chainsaw with confidence and get the very best out of it.</p>\n<p><strong>Assembly</strong>: Your new cordless brushcutter will arrive ‘boxed' and there may be a minimal element of assembly.  Read the manual carefully and keep it to hand during assembly.</p>\n<p><strong>Preparation: </strong>Before you start using your brushcutter</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Read your manual and keep it to hand until you are familiar with all the functions of your petrol powered brushcutter. </li>\n<li>Make sure you get used to the weight of your brushcutter. Try lifting and wielding it without being switched on to get used to it. Give your self plenty of room and make sure you have checked your standing position so the weight is distributed evenly. You manual should give you information on this.C</li>\n<li>Make sure you know and understand all the controls of your brushcutter. Brushcutters vary in design,   so check your manual very carefully for these details.</li>\n<li>Check any bolts/nuts/screws are tight before using</li>\n<li>Your line may feed out automatically as it wears or it may be a 'tap-n-go' 'bump-n'go' type where you tap the head to fee out more line. Make sure you know how to use the feed before you start to save time and effort.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Oil and Fuel: </strong>A 2-stroke engine uses a mixture of oil and fuel<strong>.  </strong>Using the right oil and getting the right oil to fuel ratio in a 2-stroke engine is important. </p>\n<p>This information is usually contained in your manual or owner's handbook. If not and you need further information, you can try contacting the manufacturer.</p>\n<p>Our alphabetical brand database contains contact information for virtually all our manufacturers. <a href=\"https://mowhow.mowdirect.co.uk/hc/en-gb/categories/200090047-Manufacturers\">Just click here for easy access.</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>However, MowDirect recommends two types of oil for 2-stroke engines: <strong>Synthetic Oil</strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red110\"> (<strong>red</strong></span> or <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\"><strong>blue</strong>) and </span><strong>Mineral oil</strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green120\">: (</span><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green120\"><strong>green</strong>)</span>\n</li>\n<li>The ratio of oil to fuel MowDirect recommend in general is:  <strong>Synthetic Oil:</strong> (<span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red110\"><strong>red</strong></span> or <strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">blue</span></strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">)</span> 40:1 <strong>Mineral oil</strong>: (<span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green120\"><strong>green</strong></span>) 25:1</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Starting: </strong>If you are have difficulty starting your brushcutter, it is always useful to remember that A 2-stroke engine needs three things to work - air, fuel and a spark.</p>\n<p>If your engine won’t start or there is a problem, it is likely to be one of these, or lack of one of these, that is causing it.</p>\n<p>2-stroke engines are very easy to flood so try not to over crank when starting</p>\n<p><strong>Maintenance and Storage: </strong>Regular inspection is a good way to keep on top of maintenance</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure you inspect the engine on a regular basis</li>\n<li>Check all controls like the throttle and clutch as well as the clutch drum to make sure they are working properly and make sure there is no dust gathering that might get into any working parts.</li>\n<li>Always keep your fuel-cap clean as any dirt in the engine can cause problems</li>\n<li>Always give your brushcutter a wipe-over before storage and never store the brushcutter with grass left on it. This  is important, particularly if you are using a blade as moisture can corrode the metal. </li>\n<li>Make sure you store your brushcutter in a dry place, covered if possible. It may be easier to hang it up, as this will save space and is probably safer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Servicing</strong>: Don’t forget that Annual Servicing is a recommended by the manufacturers and is a requirement if you want to extend the guarantee beyond the first year.</p>\n<p>An out of tune engine, for example, can reduce performance.</p>\n<p><strong>Health &amp; Safety</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure you are feeling well and alert before you start any brushcutting</li>\n<li>Do not operate a brushcutter under the influence of alcohol</li>\n<li>Your brushcutter may have come with a safety harness. If so, learn how you know how to fit it and use it properly before using your brushcutter. Using it properly will protect your back and offer support, so can work longer and safely.</li>\n<li>Safety Clothing &amp; Equipment: We always recommend that you wear safety goggles, at the very least, to avoid contact with flying twigs and leaves. In addition, solid, preferably steel-capped, boots would be good. Clothing should not be loose. Also, a helmet is recommended and ear defenders are also very helpful, particularly when working for longer periods. </li>\n<li>Make sure you always use the brushcutter with the safety guard on</li>\n<li>Never try to clear any blockages or put your hands near the working end of the brushcutter with the machine switched n. Always turn it off completely. </li>\n<li>Before you start, make sure that the grass where you will be working is clear of obstacles, stones, bottles, children’s toys, large sticks and similar.</li>\n<li>Make sure there no-one is standing too close to you while you are working.</li>\n<li>Make sure you keep your blades sharp. Sharp blades will enhance performance and will reduce the instance of jamming so you have your hands near the business end of the Brushcutter fewer times. Sharp blades also reduces the likelihood grass, twigs oand so on, catching flying around. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, we sincerely hope you enjoy using your petrol powered brushcutter, and that this guide has been useful, but if you have questions or problems not covered in this guide, in fact if you need any advice, don’t hesitate to contact us on <a style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"mailto:technicalsupport@mowdirect.co.uk\">technicalsupport@mowdirect.co.uk</a></p>\n<p> </p>"},{"id":201707777,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/201707777.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201707777-Tasks-tips-and-tools-for-November","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":10,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200269353,"created_at":"2014-02-20T10:55:41Z","updated_at":"2015-04-20T14:03:49Z","name":"Tasks, tips and tools for November","title":"Tasks, tips and tools for November","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2015-04-20T14:03:49Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Take a look at our quick guide to the gardening jobs to get through in November.

The leaves are falling, there’s a smell of cordite in the air, firework safety campaigns on the TV, the shops are several months into their Christmas campaigns and you can almost smell the sausages. </span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">The garden or plot in November can be a bit grim, but there is still a great deal to do and at the very least you can still be<strong> harvesting late apples, pears, berries and nuts</strong>… and if that makes it all sound a bit Ray Mears, so be it.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Some people despair of their plots or garden in this apparently gloomy month but don’t forget that <strong>you can plant in November for spring blooming</strong>. Garlic cloves can go in, broad beans and hardy varieties of pea and in the flower garden, daffodils, hyacinth and tulips, snowdrops, narcissus and crocuses for refreshing colour in early spring.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Keep raking up those leaves.</strong> If your lawn is substantial you might want to look at a <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue110\">walk-behind leaf sweeper </span>like the one below</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-small\"><em>MD Sweep 26 Lawn &amp; Leaf Sweeper</em></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200440676/md-sweep-26-lawn-leaf-sweeper-600c.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"239\" height=\"218\"></p>\r\n<p>T<span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">he lawn is getting covered and at the very least you could do with a <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue110\">good rake. </span>You can let some leaves stay on big beds to mulch on their own but either way, <strong>don’t waste those leaves.</strong> They make good mulch or compost when broken down so in the interests of recycling, why not find a way to use them.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue110\">A leaf cage</span> is a good idea. There are dozens of sets of detailed instructions out there on t’interweb, but suffice to say four stakes and some chicken wire will do the job, you can work out how to hammer the stakes in and attach the wire and then you simply take a <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue110\">good garden fork</span> , pile the damp leaves in and let nature do the rest. If you do want to help the process you can add lime and blood meal to help but left alone your leaf store will still end up being useful.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Hard frost may well be nipping everything about now, so <strong>time to harvest winter cabbages and cauliflowers</strong> if you have them. Whether you are a hobby gardener or a grow your own fanatic, you will need to get into the shed and <strong>check all your tools are well oiled, sharpened and cared for so they can survive the winter</strong> without rusting metal heads and rotting wood handles.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">This could also be a good time to prepare for possible snow… if it hasn’t started falling already. Don’t rely on your old spade. Be prepared.

With this method you need to physically remove the wheels and place them at a higher setting, usually with a snap-in system. This tends to be featured on entry-level machines and occurs nearly always on plastic wheeled mowers.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Individual Levers</strong>: With this method, each wheel has an individual lever, so to level the machine you need to adjust each wheel to the same setting.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Single Lever Rear, Individual Levers Front</strong>: Fairly self-explanatory. One lever lowers or raises the back of the deck and the front two wheels have their own levers.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Single Lever</strong>: This is a good feature found on many top-end models and is very easy and simple to use, though varying in design and quality. This system uses one single lever to raise the deck. This is frequently located to one or other side on the machine often near the axle.

Congratulations, you are now in possession of groundbreaking technology that will make working in your garden easier cleaner and less hassle, with advanced, lighter, more powerful battery tools than ever before. </p>\n<p>We are keen that you get the very best performance from your battery powered brushcutter from the very first time you ‘charge-up and go’. Subsequently, we hope the following guidelines and advice will help. They are based on our extensive experience, with reference to the sorts of questions new cordless brushcutter users regularly ask us.</p>\n<p>As a preliminary tip, do read your manuals and instruction sheets thoroughly before you start and keep them to hand while you get used to your brushcutter. They will offer you advice you may well need.<strong><em> </em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Assembly</strong>: Your new cordless brushcutter will arrive ‘boxed' and there may be a minimal element of assembly. Read the manual carefully and keep it to hand during assembly. </p>\n<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure you get used to the weight of your brushcutter. Put the battery in and try lifting and wielding it without being switched on to get used to it. </li>\n<li>Check any bolts/nuts/screws are tight before using</li>\n<li>Check battery contacts and the fit</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong> </strong><strong>Starting</strong>: If you are have difficulty starting your brushcutter, it is always advisable to check the following</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure your battery or batteries are correctly charged as per the instructions in the manual.</li>\n<li>Check the battery or batteries to see if they are fitted properly and securely in place.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Maintenance &amp; Storage:</strong> Storing your cordless brushcutter in the right place is important but there are extra considerations when storing a battery powered model</p>\n<p>Wet and rotting grass causes metal components to rust and grass and dirt in or around your brushcutter's metal blades can cause all sorts of problems. Always make sure you clean the brushcutter head regularly and thoroughly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure you store your cordless brushcutter  in a dry place, covered if possible. It may be easier to hang it up, as this will save space and is probably safer.</li>\n<li>Always give it a wipe-over before storage and never store the brushcutter with grass left on it. Never leave it, or attempt to store it or the battery, in a humid environment.</li>\n<li>Before storing your cordless brushcutter away for a long time, make sure the battery is partially charged, perhaps somewhere between 30 and 70% depending on the time they are being stored. Storing on a full charge can reduce the battery life and storing on no charge can make re-charging later potentially difficult.</li>\n<li>Try to make sure you store your battery or batteries at a reasonable temperature, not in any extremes of hot and cold as this can also affect the charging cycles and battery life, make sure you don’t store them near or on boilers or radiators and avoid leaving them in a hot car or by a window in the sun.</li>\n<li>Try to ensure that batteries are not stored in such a way that metal can touch the contacts as this can damage them and is, potentially, dangerous.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Health &amp; Safety:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure you are fit and alert when using your cordless brushcutter. Don't use this tool, or any powered tools, if you are fatigued, unwell or under the influence of alcohol.</li>\n<li>Make sure you always use the brushcutter with the safety guard on</li>\n<li>Before you start  check the grass where you will be working is clear of obstacles, stones, bottles,  children’s toys, large sticks and similar.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Performance: </strong>If you are having trouble cutting grass or you think the brushcutter is not cutting or running properly, here are some things to consider.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Again, make sure your battery or batteries are charged correctly</li>\n<li>Avoid touching the battery contacts as this can affect battery performance. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Servicing</strong>: Don’t forget that Annual Servicing is recommended by the manufacturers and is often a requirement if you want to extend the guarantee beyond the first year.</p>\n<p> And finally, we’d like to thank you for your custom. Hopefully these tips and guidelines will help you enjoy your new cordless brushcutter and get trouble free and satisfactory operation from it.

Even herald angels are wrapping up against the cold, Holly and Ivy are springing up all over the place and choirs of cherubic children are coughing their way through nativity play rehearsals. <strong>Time to harvest your winter radishes and brussels sprouts,</strong> in fact,anyone who doesn't watch cookery programmes will be putting the sprouts on a medium heat about now, ready for Christmas lunch. <strong>Any sprouts you intend to stay in the ground should be earthed up.</strong> </span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Watch out for caterpillars</strong> on the leaves of your sprouts or any brassicas. <strong>Pick them off by hand </strong>if you see any. You can <strong>plant rhubarb </strong>at this time and <strong>carry out more preparation of your beds</strong> for onions, peas and potatoes. Again, don’t try it in the wet, wait for a decent day (there is nothing like a cold crisp, bright December day for working in the garden)</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Don’t forget to <strong>cover your prepared ground </strong>with <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue90\">polythene sheeting</span> or the like.

Use a <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue110\">good wide lawn rake</span>.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">You probably won’t need to mow your lawn more than once this month, and even then, only if you get a dry day.

These include ‘grass bags’, ‘grass boxes’, ‘grass catchers’ and the generic ‘grass collectors’. For simplicity sake in this article we will call them grass collectors.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">You might think that the grass collector on your lawn mower is a simple, basic requirement, an afterthought when it comes to design and function. But you would be wrong. Grass collector design is a significant factor in the efficiency and function of a lawn mower. Here are a few important facts,  functions and details which we hope will be useful. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>CONSTRUCTION</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Grass collectors tend to be either fabric (canvas/nylon etc) or solid plastic, usually aerated.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><em><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-small\">Plastic collector</span>                                   </span></em><em><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-small\">Canvas collector                             </span></em><em><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-small\">Canvas &amp; plastic top</span></em></p>\r\n<p><img class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\" src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200566626/MB_253_T3_zoom_rdax_85.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"174\" height=\"147\">   <img class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200566656/md-41sp-petrol-self-propelled-lawnmower-900c.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"163\" height=\"147\"> <img class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-right\" src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200656643/mountfield-sp46-self-propelled-petrol-lawnmower-m.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"179\" height=\"146\"><em><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-small\">                 <br></span></em></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Storage</strong>. Fabric collectors can be collapsed to aid storage.</span></li>\r\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Airflow</strong>. The air moved through the collector by the blade motion can be a major factor in efficient collection. For this reason you will see that most collectors, even solid plastic ones, have air holes. The airflow helps prevent clumping and helps the grass distribution in the collector. Airflow is probably at its best in a fabric collector</span></li>\r\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Dust</strong>. Plastic or hard topped collectors will keep dust from irritating the operator when conditions are dry. Even fabric collectors will often have a hard top to do this, offering the best of both worlds</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>CAPACITY: </strong>The size of your grass collector will make a difference. The larger the collector, the fewer times you have to stop to empty it and the quicker you can get your job done. Capacities on domestic mowers range from about 20 litres on smaller machines up to around 80 litres. Go for the largest capacity in your price range</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>FULL INDICATOR: </strong>A good feature to watch out for, this is also incredibly useful. An indictor that tells you your collector is full prevents spilling, avoiding you having to stop, bend and pick up grass from the lawn. It also means you do not have to continually check whether you have filled the bag. These indicators usually work by means of a flip-up plastic tag that is pushed up by the grass in the bag, popping up to show ‘full’ or a change of colour.

Use a sweeping action both up and down mowing forward along the hedge as you go.</li>\n<li>For the top of the hedge, try to keep the blades at an angle of around 10° (degrees) against the horizontal plane and this time use a horizontal sweeping motion to cut.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Maintenance</strong>: Here are a few useful tips to keep your trimmer working well…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are storing your Hedgetrimmer away for a long period, empty out the petrol as it modern fuel will deteriorate, leave deposits and, can damage your engine.</li>\n<li>Always keep your fuel cap clean any dirt in the engine can cause problems</li>\n<li>Make sure you clean the blades after each use so no sap or other substance can clog up or damage them</li>\n<li>After every use, check that no pieces of foliage, twigs or other detritus have got into the mechanism</li>\n<li>Give the trimmer a good wipe after every use to avoid moisture-causing damage.</li>\n<li>Always keep your blades well lubricated. Lubricate them after each use with WD 40 or similar with the machine safely switched off and before each use as well.

you are reading this you have no doubt invested in one or more battery powered garden tools including your cordless hedgetrimmer and, in the process, you have also invested in the future. Congratulations. You are now in possession of groundbreaking technology that will make working in your garden easier cleaner, less hassle, with advanced, lighter, more powerful battery tools than ever before. </p>\n<p>We are keen that you get the very best performance from your battery powered hedgetrimmer from the very first time you ‘charge-up and go’. Subsequently, we hope the following guidelines and advice will help. They are based on our extensive experience, with reference to the sorts of questions new cordless hedgetrimmer users regularly ask us.</p>\n<p>As a preliminary tip, do read your manuals and instruction sheets thoroughly before you start and keep them to hand while you get used to your machine. They will offer you advice you may well need.<strong><em> </em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Assembly</strong>: Your new battery powered hedgetrimmer will arrive ‘boxed' and there may be a minimal element of assembly. </p>\n<p><strong>Preparation</strong>: Before you use your hedgetrimmer for the first time </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure you get used to the weight of your trimmer. Put the battery in and try lifting and wielding it without being switched on to get used to it. </li>\n<li>Check all your bolts/nuts/screws are tight before using</li>\n<li>Check battery contacts and fit</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Starting</strong>: If you are have difficulty starting your hedgetrimmer, it is always advisable to check the following.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure your battery or batteries are correctly charged as per the instructions in the manual.</li>\n<li>Check the battery or batteries to see if they are fitted properly and securely in place.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Storage:</strong> Storing your mower in the right place is important but there are extra considerations when storing a battery powered model</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure you store your cordless hedgetrimmer in a dry place, covered if possible. Always give it a wipe-over before storage and never store the trimmer with grass or mud left on it.</li>\n<li>Never leave or attempt to store them them in a humid environment.</li>\n<li>Before storing your cordless hedgetrimmer away for a long time, make sure the battery is partially charged, perhaps somewhere between 30 and 70% depending on the time it is  being stored. Storing on a full charge can reduce the battery life and storing on no charge can make re-charging later potentially difficult.</li>\n<li>Try to make sure you store your battery at a reasonable temperature, not in any extremes of hot and cold as this can also affect the charging cycles and battery life, make sure you don’t store it near or on boilers or radiators and avoid leaving it in a hot car or by a window in the sun.</li>\n<li>Try to ensure that battery is not stored in such a way that metal can touch the contacts as this can damage them and is, potentially, dangerous. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Performance And Usage tips </strong>Your cordless hedgetrimmer should be fairly easy to use, but it is worth remembering a couple of things…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you have a motor cut out or stutter, check your battery contacts to see they are clean and the battery is fitted properly. </li>\n<li>You should trim or cut the sides (the vertical) of a hedge first. use a sweeping action both up and down mowing forward along the hedge as you go.</li>\n<li>For the top of the hedge, try to keep the blades at an angle of around 10° (degrees) against the horizontal plane and this time use a horizontal sweeping motion to cut.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Maintenance</strong>: Cordless battery hedgetrimmers should require very little maintenance, however, here are a few useful tips to keep them working well year in year out.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure you clean the blades after each use so no sap or other substance can clog up or damage them</li>\n<li>After every use, check that no pieces of foliage, twigs or other detritus have got into the mechanism</li>\n<li>Give the Hedgetrimmer a good wipe after every use to avoid moisture-causing damage.</li>\n<li>Always keep your blades well lubricated.

These are very popular and are exclusively mowing machines, designed for maintenance of large lawns. They differ from ride-on tractors, which are for larger mowing tasks and can also be used for towing and attaching other implements like cultivators and trailers. Grass collectors are often included as these machines are ideal for wet and dry grass collection.

Powerful and capable of towing attachments as well as mowing these, like the rear collect tractors can be great all round garden vehicles as well as effective mowers. They will collect grass in dry conditions but are not ideal for wet collection due to the distance from the deck to the collector. Grass collectors tend to be sold as an optional extra for these, rather than being included.

They are usually controlled by two levers or paddles (see image below) which control both forward, and reverse motion and then turn the ride-on on the spot if you push one forward and pull the other back.

They sit between the smaller domestic tractors and full-on agricultural tractors. They will have cutting decks of around 127cm to 152 and engines of  23m to 30 horsepower, often three-cylinder.  They will be able to deal with heavy-duty attachments, ploughs, cultivators, sweepers etc and can cover very large expanses of lawn and rougher terrain. Some of them run on diesel and they will often come with mulching capability, even able to mulch long grass in orchards and meadows. Some, like the Westwood models, use a sweeper system which uses a powerful brush to lift the clippings, plus leave sand other debris into a collector. This particular type of large-scale ride-ons are also fitted with metal rollers at the rear so that if you mow in alternate directions you can produce a well defined stripe on your lawn. </p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\">Heavy Duty Garden Tractor</p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-small\"><em>                    <img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200488423/westwoodheavydutygardentractor.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"357\" height=\"224\">                                                  image courtesy of Westwood                                        </em></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"> </p>"},{"id":201583933,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/201583933.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201583933-What-are-lawn-mower-cutting-decks-made-of-","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":13,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200261416,"created_at":"2014-01-09T16:16:59Z","updated_at":"2015-04-23T09:59:44Z","name":"What are lawn mower cutting decks made of?","title":"What are lawn mower cutting decks made of?","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2015-04-23T09:59:44Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">There are three main materials used in the manufacture of lawnmower decks.

climb. </div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>Low cost and easy to use, the electric and cordless battery powered models are ideal for small and medium sized properties. </div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>Once the domain of professionals, but now frequently priced within the reach of domestic users, Petrol Long Reach Hedgetrimmers  are powerful with heavy-duty blades and gearing, offering very efficient cutting. </div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>Some models are telescopic, which not only delivers flexibility, but also means that they are easier to store away when work has finished. </div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>\n<strong>NB</strong>: <em>The features and functions you would expect from long reach hedgetrimmers are the same as you would find on other electric, cordless or petrol models, depending on your choice. i.e. powerful motors and engines, strong, precision ground blades, ergonomics, and comfort handles are all features to expect or watch out for.

hope that the following collection of tips and advice on maintenance safety and useage will save you time and enable you to use your electric hedgetrimmerr with total confidence.</p>\n<p> <strong>Preparation</strong>: Before you use your Hedgetrimmer for the first time…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure you get used to the weight of your trimmer. Try lifting and wielding it without it being switched on to get used to the weight and balance. </li>\n<li>Check all your bolts/nuts/screws are tight before using</li>\n</ul>\n<p> <strong>Performance And Usage tips </strong>Your Hedgetrimmer should be fairly easy to use, but it is worth remembering a couple of things… </p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you have a motor cut out or stutter, check your plug and socket to see if the cable is secure. Make sure it has not come loose, or been yanked out, or become tangled and caught on foliage.</li>\n<li>You should trim or cut the sides (the vertical) of a hedge first. use a sweeping action both up and down mowing forward along the hedge as you go.</li>\n<li>For the top of the hedge, try to keep the blades at an angle of around 10° (degrees) against the horizontal plane and this time use a horizontal sweeping motion to cut.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Maintenance</strong>: Electric Hedgetrimmers should require very little maintenance, however, here are a few useful tips to keep them working well year in year out.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure you clean the blades after each use so no sap or other substance can clog up or damage them</li>\n<li>After every use, check that no pieces of foliage, twigs or other detritus have got into the mechanism</li>\n<li>Give the Hedgetrimmer a good wipe after every use to avoid moisture-causing damage.</li>\n<li>Always keep your blades well lubricated. Lubricate them after each use with WD 40 or similar with the machine safely switched off and before each use as well. If you can.</li>\n<li>Store your Hedgetrimmer in a clean, dry place between uses</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Servicing</strong>: Don’t forget that Annual Servicing is a recommended by the manufacturers and is a requirement if you want to extend the guarantee beyond the first year.</p>\n<p><strong>Health &amp; Safety:</strong><strong> </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is advisable to wear safety goggles when using your Hedgetrimmers to avoid potential injury from flying twigs or fronds. A pair of sturdy work boots and good, strong gardening gloves is also highly advisable.</li>\n<li>Keep any other persons a good distance away while you are operating the Hedgetrimmer</li>\n<li>Make sure you keep your hands clear of the trimmer during operation and always use the hand guard where fitted.</li>\n<li>Cable management. This is very important. It seems obvious but you would be surprised at how many people still cut their cable by mistake.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> We hope you enjoy using your Electric Hedgetrimmer and if you have questions or issues not covered by this guide, don’t hesitate to contact us on <a href=\"mailto:technicalsupport@mowdirect.co.uk\">technicalsupport@mowdirect.co.uk</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sally (Technical<em> Co-Coordinator</em>)</p>\n<p><em> </em></p>"},{"id":201991508,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/201991508.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201991508-How-do-I-adjust-the-cutting-height-on-my-ride-on-","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":14,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200262686,"created_at":"2014-02-13T12:43:41Z","updated_at":"2014-04-23T15:24:01Z","name":"How do I adjust the cutting height on my ride-on?","title":"How do I adjust the cutting height on my ride-on?","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2014-04-02T13:06:46Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<p>Contemporary ride-on mowers of all types tend to have easy to use, close-to-hand lever operated cutting height adjustment.

have assembled this guide, a varied collection of tips and advice on safety, usage, fuel and maintenance, to  save you time and enable you to use your Petrol Chainsaw with confidence.</p>\n<p> <strong>Preparation</strong>: Before you use your chainsaw for the first time</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure you get used to the weight of your chainsaw. Try lifting and wielding it without it being switched on to get used to it.</li>\n<li>Check all your bolts/nuts/screws are tight before using</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Engine Information: </strong>If your engine is a 4-stroke, you need only remember to use fresh, unleaded fuel in your engine and<strong> never</strong> leave petrol in the tank for more than 30 days </p>\n<p> N. B. <strong>If your engine is a 2–stroke version there some things it is worth knowing</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have to mix the petrol with engine oil and get the mix right. We recommend the following ratio:                 <strong>Synthetic Oil: (red or blue) 40:1     Mineral Oil: (green) 25:1</strong>\n</li>\n<li>A 2-stroke engine needs three things to work - air, fuel and a spark. If your engine won’t start or there is a problem, it is likely to be one of these, or lack of one of these, that is causing it<strong>.</strong>\n</li>\n<li>2-stroke engines are easy to flood so try not to over crank when starting</li>\n</ul>\n<p> <strong>Maintenance</strong>: Regular inspection is a good way to keep on top of maintenance</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure you inspect the engine on a regular basis</li>\n<li>Make sure the chain is free running and at the right tension. Keep the chain lubricated and clean.</li>\n<li>Check all controls like the throttle and clutch as well as the clutch drum to make sure they are working properly and make sure there is no dust gathering that might get into any working parts.</li>\n<li>Check and clean your chain Brake regularly and give it at least one trial run before every use.</li>\n<li>Take a look at your Chain Catcher and check it for wear.</li>\n<li>Check all your Hand Guards and Handles and make sure they are stable and solid.</li>\n<li>Always keep your fuel-cap clean as any dirt in the engine can cause problems</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong> </strong><strong>Servicing</strong>: Don’t forget that Annual Servicing is a recommended by the manufacturers and is a requirement if you want to extend the guarantee beyond the first year. An out of tune engine, for example, can reduce performance.</p>\n<p> <strong>Health &amp; Safety: </strong>A chainsaw needs safe handling. These tips should help</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is <strong>VERY HIGHLY RECCOMENDED</strong> that you wear safety clothing when using your chainsaw to avoid potential injury. At the very least a helmet, a pair of sturdy metal toecap work boots and strong gloves, ear defenders and goggles.</li>\n<li>You should be \"reasonably fit both physically and mentally” before attempting to use a chainsaw so, before you start any work, make sure you are feeling well and alert.</li>\n<li>Make sure you are not suffering from the effects of alcohol and that you are not over tired. Hopefully you have chosen a chainsaw that is not too heavy for your physical strength. E</li>\n<li>Take regular rests and avoid stretching or straining during use. (<em>However, if you do find your chainsaw particularly unwieldy or difficult, please contact us on the e-mail address below to discuss this.)</em>\n</li>\n<li>Don’t ever make cuts with the saw between your legs; you should make sure your chainsaw is always outside of your legs, to the side. Don’t ever stand on a log and saw between your feet.</li>\n<li>Always stand to one side of the branch or log you are cutting.</li>\n<li>Do bear in mind that if there is a chain problem and it breaks or comes loose it will probably whip straight back so NEVER be in line with the chain and make sure no one else is in line with it.</li>\n<li>Try to power down, or de-throttle, the second you have finished cutting.</li>\n<li>Don’t ever move from cutting area to area with the chain in cutting mode and never run with the chainsaw</li>\n<li>Always transport your chainsaw in a case if possible, but at the very least with a guard on the chain and bar.</li>\n<li>Make sure you keep a tip guard on your saw during use whenever possible. This will help prevent kickback.</li>\n<li>Try to avoid cutting with the blade tip, this will help avoid kickback.</li>\n<li>Try to cut below shoulder height wherever possible. This will keep a chainsaw away from your shoulders and head in the event of kickback.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We sincerely hope you enjoy using your chainsaw and if you have questions or issues not covered in this guide, don’t hesitate to contact us on <a href=\"mailto:technicalsupport@mowdirect.co.uk\">technicalsupport@mowdirect.co.uk</a></p>"},{"id":201542857,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/201542857.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201542857-Rear-or-side-discharge-ride-on-Which-is-the-best-","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":15,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200262686,"created_at":"2014-02-09T16:33:05Z","updated_at":"2014-04-23T15:22:23Z","name":"Rear or side discharge ride-on.

However, ‘Which lawn mower engine is best?’ is a tough question. Ask 100 owners and you will probably get 100 different opinions.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">It is probably more helpful to ask \"which engine is best for me?\" </span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">For example, if you have a small ‘pocket handkerchief’ size lawn, it is probably foolish to fork out for a mower with a massive engine that could grace the armoury of Norwich City FC’s groundsman.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">So here are 5 handy tips on choosing an engine.</span></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Cost - </strong>always buy the best you can afford.

If you are not happy with that, prepare to pay a professional to do it or think about a cordless or electric mower as an alternative.</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Here is some more general information on lawn mower engines which may help.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">All lawn mower engines are 4-stroke and air cooled. Most are OHV (overhead valve) for increased efficiency, fuel economy and fewer emissions.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">The two top name engine manufacturers are <strong>Briggs &amp; Stratton</strong> and <strong>Honda.</strong> Both are featured on high-end machines by many manufacturers, including their own models.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Honda lawn mower engines use overhead cams in their engines, which are of course, to their own design. These have a number of advantages, including increasing efficiency and power output for a given torque.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Loncin</strong> is a very good Chinese engine manufacturer that is gaining a growing reputation for quality and reliability as well as value all round.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">As well as this, many manufacturers are now fitting their own brand engines. These are often a cheaper, but perfectly adequate and workable, alternative to big brand names and often have great features like easy-starting and low engine noise. </span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">If you would like to see a range of mowers and compare by engine size or power, just click here - <strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue110\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Mower </span></span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue110\">comparison by engine size</span></span></strong></span></p>"},{"id":201185966,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/201185966.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201185966-What-features-and-functions-should-I-look-for-on-a-professional-chipper-or-shredder-","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":15,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200263016,"created_at":"2013-12-31T10:50:08Z","updated_at":"2014-04-23T15:20:56Z","name":"What features and functions should I look for on a professional chipper or shredder?","title":"What features and functions should I look for on a professional chipper or shredder?","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2013-12-31T10:50:08Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<div>•  Very powerful petrol OHV engine from around 140cc upwards, frequently from respected engine manufacturers like Briggs and Stratton<br>\n</div><div><br></div><div>•  A large cutting capacity around from 90mm up to 200mm or more</div><div><br></div><div>•  Strong dual purpose mechanism – a robust flywheel with sharp, strong blades for chipping and with blades, flail hammers* (or both) for shredding </div><div><br></div><div>•  Dual-purpose large and heavy-duty hopper/chute for dealing with branches and loose material</div><div><br></div><div>•  Heavy-duty steel construction</div><div><br></div><div>•  Large transport wheels with pneumatic tyres for extra traction and stability</div><div><br></div><div>•  Reversible blades</div><div><br></div><div>•  Hitch/tow bar for attaching to garden vehicles for improved mobility/versatility</div><div><br></div><div>•  Belt drive transmission<br>\n</div><div><br></div><div>•  Ability to tackle any kind of waste including kitchen waste</div><div>\n<br><br>*<i> or a similar strong and durable cutting system. </i><br>\n</div>"},{"id":201166186,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/201166186.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201166186-Some-useful-advanced-features-to-look-out-for-in-snow-blowers","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":15,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200272768,"created_at":"2013-12-23T12:43:07Z","updated_at":"2014-04-23T15:20:49Z","name":"Some useful advanced features to look out for in snow blowers","title":"Some useful advanced features to look out for in snow blowers","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2013-12-23T12:57:58Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"These are features you would expect to find on more advanced models, but can be very useful and helpful<br><ul>\n<li>Variable speed control.

Congratulations. You are now in possession of groundbreaking technology that will make working in your garden easier cleaner, less hassle, with advanced, lighter, more powerful battery tools than ever before. </p>\n<p>We are keen that you get the very best performance from your battery powered chainsaws from the very first time you ‘charge-up and go’. Subsequently, we hope the following guidelines and advice will help. They are based on our extensive experience, with reference to the sorts of questions new cordless chainsaw users regularly ask us.</p>\n<p>As a preliminary tip, do read your manuals and instruction sheets thoroughly before you start and keep them to hand while you get used to your machine. They will offer you advice you may well need.<strong><em> </em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Preparation</strong>: Before you use your chainsaw for the first time… </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure you get used to the weight of your cordless chainsaw. Try lifting and wielding it without it being switched on to get used to it.</li>\n<li>Check all your bolts/nuts/screws are tight before using</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Maintenance</strong>: The motor of a cordless chainsaw should require little or no maintenance, however, there are many elements to a chainsaw, so regular inspection and looking after the chain, guide bar and safety features is very important… </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure the chain is free running and at the right tension. Keep the chain lubricated and clean.</li>\n<li>Check and clean your Chain Brake regularly and give it at least one trial run before every use.</li>\n<li>Take a look at your Chain Catcher and check it for wear.</li>\n<li>Check all your Hand Guards and Handles and make sure they are stable and solid.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Servicing</strong>: Don’t forget that Annual Servicing is recommended by the manufacturers and is a requirement if you want to extend the guarantee beyond the first year. An out of tune engine, for example, can reduce performance.</p>\n<p> <strong>Health &amp; Safety: </strong>A chainsaw needs safe handling. These tips should help<strong> </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is <strong>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</strong> that you wear safety clothing when using your chainsaw to avoid potential injury. At the very least, a pair of sturdy metal toecap work boots and strong gloves, ear defenders and goggles. </li>\n<li>You should be \"reasonably fit both physically and mentally” before attempting to use a chainsaw so, before you start any work, make sure you are feeling well and alert. Also make sure you are not suffering from the effects of alcohol and that you are not over tired. Hopefully you have chosen a chainsaw that is not too heavy for your physical strength. (see preparation notes above) Even so, take regular rests and avoid stretching or straining during use.  <em>However, if you do find your chainsaw particularly unwieldy or difficult please contact us on the e-mail address below to discuss this.</em>\n</li>\n<li>Don’t ever make cuts with the saw between your legs; you should make sure your chainsaw is always outside of your legs, to the side. Don’t ever stand on a log and saw between your feet.</li>\n<li>Always stand to one side of the branch or log you are cutting.</li>\n<li>Do bear in mind that if there is a chain problem and it breaks or comes loose, it will probably whip straight back so NEVER be in line with the chain and make sure no one else is in line with it.</li>\n<li>Try to switch off the second you have finished cutting.</li>\n<li>Don’t ever move from cutting area to area with the chain in cutting mode and NEVER run with the chainsaw</li>\n<li>Always transport your chainsaw in a case if possible, but at the very least put a guard on the chain and bar.</li>\n<li>Make sure you keep a tip guard on your saw during use whenever possible. This will help prevent kickback.</li>\n<li>Try to avoid cutting with the blade tip, this will help avoid kickback.</li>\n<li>Try to cut below shoulder height wherever possible. This will keep a chainsaw away from your shoulders and head in the event of kickback.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> Finally, thank you so much for your custom.

It can be used to create kindling.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Servicing</strong></p>\n<p>Electric log splitters require very little maintenance, however, don’t forget that annual servicing is a recommended by the manufacturers and is a requirement if you want to extend the guarantee beyond the first year.</p>\n<p>Make sure you speak to your dealer about this, as, for example, an out of tune engine can result in reduced performance</p>\n<p><strong>Health &amp; Safety</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is advisable to wear safety goggles when using your log splitter to avoid potential injury from flying splinters. A pair of heavy work boots is also advisable.</li>\n<li>Make sure you place your log splitter on a steady and solid surface before using.</li>\n<li>Keep any other persons a good distance away while you are operating the splitter.</li>\n<li>Make sure you keep your hands clear of the machine during operation and always use the hand guards where fitted.</li>\n<li>Keep hands clear of cracks in logs as these are often unstable and can close on your fingers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, we hope you enjoy using your electric log splitter and if you have problems not covered by this guide, don’t hesitate to contact us on <a href=\"mailto:technicalsupport@mowdirect.co.uk\">technicalsupport@mowdirect.co.uk</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em> </em></p>"},{"id":201762327,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/201762327.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201762327-Am-I-too-heavy-or-too-light-to-operate-a-ride-on-mower-or-tractor-","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":17,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200262686,"created_at":"2014-03-04T14:37:17Z","updated_at":"2014-04-23T15:22:52Z","name":"Am I too heavy or too light to operate a ride-on mower or tractor?

They are...</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Recoil Start</strong> - by far the most common way of starting a lawn mower is with a recoil chord. The recoil is a length of strong chord that is wrapped around a spindle or reel attached to the top of the crankshaft. When it is pulled it spins the crankshaft and as the flywheel continues to spin, the engine is cranked into life.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">This starting method is also occasionally known as a 'manual start', 'pull start' or sometimes a 'zip start'.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">The recoil start traditionally took a lot of muscular effort, as you will know if you own an older model petrol lawn mower, but, in recent years, many manufacturers have worked hard to make the job easier and now they are not that difficult to work with.  In addition, there are many trademarked starting systems with trade-names like ‘easy-start’, (Briggs &amp; Stratton) 'quick-start’ 'smart-start' and so on.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">The recoil chord was traditionally pulled straight from the engine housing in lawn mowers but is now often mounted at the handle, reducing a lot of the compression that was involved before, making the pull a lot easier as well as removing the need to bend.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">It is also mounted on the handles as a safety feature so that you are further away from the blades when you start the mower and can operate the OPC (Operator Presence Control)* more easily. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Electric Start </strong>- pretty much as it sounds, an electric start, will replace the recoil for convenience and ease. The electric start is switch, button or sometimes key operated. Electric starts are ideal for those who find the recoil action difficult and they can save some time and effort.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">All electric start mowers still include a recoil start in addition to use as a back up.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>N.B.</strong> It might seem obvious but do make sure there is fuel in the tank and the mower is turned on. You'd be amazed how often this is the problem. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><em>* </em></span></strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><em>Don't</em></span><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><em><em> forget if you let the bail arm (OPC) go , the engine will stop.

height=\"310\"></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">As autumn comes to an end and you can feel winter is approaching, it's very easy to retreat quickly indoors and forget about the whole thing until the sun shines again.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">However, there are a number of jobs you could do that will make the beginning of the next season that bit easier, and one of them is sorting out and cleaning out your greenhouse in advance of the winter.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Preparing your greenhouse for the winter will not only this make working in there easier when the growing season rolls around, it will also mean your greenhouse will cope with the winter much better as will any plants you want to keep while its cold.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">It also means the greenhouse will be more useful to you when you need it again, giving you time in spring to get on with gardening, and cleaning it may keep away pests that can get in there and make a home while you are away.  </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Try to do this on a day, or days, that are not too blustery or wet and wrap up in layers of old clothes to keep yourself warm (a flask of hot tea always helps too). Make sure you wear gardening glove and goggles are always useful if there are bits of soil, twigs or other detritus flying about. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>1.</strong> Clearing out old pots, buts of wood, dead plants and so on is probably your first task. Use old plants, twigs and leaves for compost and clean and clean your empty pots, then stack them to re-use when you can you can. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Make absolutely sure that any diseased plants have been disposed of properly. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>2.</strong> Any plants that are still viable and you are keeping, should be put in a sheltered place and maybe wrapped up to keep warm while you work. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>3</strong>. Clean your tools thoroughly, then put them safely away in storage somewhere dry, wrapped up in rags and, preferably, with any blades or tines oiled. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>4.</strong> Clean your surfaces thoroughly. Sweep or vacuum them of dust and detritus and then wipe them down with disinfectant or with soapy hot water mixed with a disinfectant. You could use a dedicated greenhouse cleaner if you wish.*</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>5.</strong> Wipe and clean the window frames, door-jambs and any other wooden or plastic supports, or parts.* </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>6</strong>. Check the doors and any opening panels. Make sure they're working properly. Many greenhouses feature sliding doors, so clean out the runner grooves and make sure nothing is bent out of shape. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>7.</strong> Clean your glass panels, the outside and the inside, as if they were regular windows. This will allow the most light in during the cold months for your surviving plants. Again, hot water and a window cleaner will do the job. Have a good look at every glass panel to make sure they are intact. If there are cracks and, or broken panes, replace them if possible. Be VERY careful with the glass and ALWAYS wear protective gloves to handle the panes.* </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>8.</strong> Consider re-painting and/or waterproofing the timbers of your greenhouse, but do be careful not to drop any of your waterproofing agents or paint on any surviving plants. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">* <em>You could clean both your surfaces, your frames and even the glass panes with a pressure washer if you have one, but make sure it is on a very gentle setting or you could end up replacing a great deal of glass and wood. </em></span></p>\n<p> </p>"},{"id":360001265851,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/360001265851.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360001265851-What-features-and-functions-would-I-find-on-a-cordless-battery-powered-tiller","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":0,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200299593,"created_at":"2018-02-27T16:39:32Z","updated_at":"2018-02-27T16:44:23Z","name":"What features and functions would I find on a cordless battery powered tiller","title":"What features and functions would I find on a cordless battery powered tiller","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2018-02-27T16:44:23Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360001483172/greenworks_40v_cordless_tiller__27087__internet_gardener_-_2015-05-27_16.jpg\" alt=\"greenworks_40v_cordless_tiller__27087__internet_gardener_-_2015-05-27_16.jpg\" width=\"338\" height=\"338\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\">Greenworks battery-powered tiller</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Light but strong construction</li>\n<li>Strong metal tines to break-up soil</li>\n<li>Good manoeuvrability</li>\n<li>Short charging-time</li>\n<li>Durable gear-driven transmission</li>\n<li>A high-performance lithium-ion battery with long-running, and short charging times</li>\n<li>No loss of power when stored</li>\n<li>Low noise</li>\n<li>Adjustable depth-gauge</li>\n<li>Low vibration</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some models will also feature...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adjustable tilling-width</li>\n<li>Smooth-running guide wheels</li>\n<li>Comfort-grip sleeve on handles</li>\n<li>Folding handles for easy storage<br>Two-stage safety start-switch to avoid accidental starting</li>\n<li>Swappable batteries so one battery can power a number of machines</li>\n</ul>"},{"id":360001252771,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/360001252771.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360001252771-How-to-use-a-front-tine-tiller","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":0,"vote_sum":1,"vote_count":1,"section_id":200247777,"created_at":"2018-02-27T13:33:27Z","updated_at":"2020-08-18T15:08:34Z","name":"How to use a front tine tiller","title":"How to use a front tine tiller","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2018-03-05T10:30:49Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360001481711/Fotolia_140853705_XS.jpg\" alt=\"Fotolia_140853705_XS.jpg\" width=\"534\" height=\"357\"></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Using a <a href=\"https://mowhow.mowdirect.co.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/201118377-Petrol-front-tine-tillers\">mechanical front tine tiller</a> can be a very time saving and efficient way to cultivate your soil, renew your plot or even assist in starting a vegetable patch or flower bed from scratch. These powerful machines are designed to make a back-challenging job easier and faster. You can learn more about <a href=\"https://mowhow.mowdirect.co.uk/hc/en-gb/sections/200299593-Cultivators-Tillers-and-Rotavators-\">the actual machines on these pages</a>, but this article is aimed at you as an owner and is intended to be a simple guide to using your tiller effectively.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>1.</strong> Make absolutely sure the patch of ground is clear of large stones, roots, branches or anything else that might cause damage to your tiller. Then a good rake, scrape and check for medium-sized or smaller stones and debris will make sure you are clear. All this could save time and money. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>2.</strong> Wear sensible, hard-wearing clothing. At the very least wear sturdy shoes or boots, preferably steel toe-capped, and good quality gardening or riggers gloves. Also, we thoroughly recommend wearing goggles or eye defenders of some sort, as small stones and earth can be thrown around and you really don’t want to be hit in the eye by flying debris. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>3.</strong> Make sure you mark out your tilling area in advance unless it is very obvious. If your area is oblong, do your tilling in stripes down the longest route, starting in one corb=ner and working your way up and down to the opposite corner. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>4.</strong> Plan your cultivating depth. Most front tine tillers will have an <a href=\"https://mowhow.mowdirect.co.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/201094448-What-features-and-functions-should-I-look-for-In-a-petrol-front-tine-tiller-\">adjustable working depth facility</a> and will usually feature a <a href=\"https://mowhow.mowdirect.co.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/201094378-Petrol-mini-tillers\">depth gauge</a> that helps you keep to your tilling depth as you work your plot, so make sure you set this correctly. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>5.</strong> Starting your tiller depends on the type of machine you have. We are assuming you are using <a href=\"https://mowhow.mowdirect.co.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/201118377-Petrol-front-tine-tillers\">a petrol front tine tiller</a>, with a 4-stroke engine, then it is pretty much like starting a 4-stroke engine lawnmower. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Engage the choke, open up the throttle to midway and then pull firmly and sharply on the recoil rope or handle. Once started, the choke lever or handle should be returned to the open position. Let the engine run a cycle or two before moving off. Then open up the throttle to speed up the motor and engage the tines.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>N.B. </strong>Remember to keep control and maintain a very firm hold on your handles at this juncture. You should expect the tiller to move forward sharply so you will need to rein it in a little.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">With a <a href=\"https://mowhow.mowdirect.co.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/360001265851-What-features-and-functions-would-I-find-on-a-cordless-battery-powered-tiller\">battery-powered tiller</a> or an <a href=\"https://mowhow.mowdirect.co.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/201359443-What-features-and-functions-should-I-look-for-on-an-electric-tiller-\">electric mains powered tiller</a>, it is mainly a case of switching the power on and then </span>engaging the <span style=\"font-size: small;\">tines. However, the above note regarding a good grip and control still applies! </span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>6.</strong> Allow the tiller to move forward. Be aware that there will be a certain amount of jerking back and forth as the machine deals with heavy clumps of soil. If the machine gets stuck, move it from side to side as you also try to move forward.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"> <a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/oleo-mac-mh175rk-front-tine-tiller-with-reverse-drive.html\">Some tillers have a reverse gear,</a> this is useful if you need to back out and go forward again, and also for getting right up to the ends of rows. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>7.</strong> Don’t just take one pass over the garden. Your soil will benefit from being turned several times so try to make a number of passes in different directions. This will help your later efforts of raking and preparation much easier, as the finer the tilth, the easier the work is and the better condition your soil is in.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>8.</strong> When you have finished, and the machine is safely turned off, do remember to clean your tiller. Mud and organic debris around the tines or engine can lead to corrosion and permanent damage. Store your tiller somewhere dry and safe.  </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Please visit these pages if you want to see <a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/cultivators-tillers-rotavators\">the range of tillers, cultivators and rotavators we stock.</a></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">And if you need further help on these machines, or anything else, do call us on <strong>0345 4588 905 (9am-5pm Mon-Fri &amp; 10am-4pm Sat)</strong> and one of our friendly product experts will be very happy to give you impartial advice.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">'<em>Have now used them twice, advice and service were excellent'</em> J.

This is, after all, the temperate climate of the UK and we are used to at least a few major soaks at whatever time of year they decide to visit us.  </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Good for the garden, good for the lawn, good for the ducks but not so good for your precious shed. Be it a storeroom, a workroom, a shelter, a tea room, a haven from the family, a napping place or just a home for the trusty mower, your shed is important. So don't let it suffer and rot under the impact of the weather, make it weatherproof. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">If your shed was ready-made, and it's a good one, it was quite probably weatherproofed when you bought it, and no doubt if you built one from scratch from old pieces or even a kit, you made sure it was protected. But how old is it? How many seasons of rain, snow, sleet and forst have landed on it? No weatherproofing lasts forever. Bought from a DIY store, in kit form, whole or made from old bits, you can see to it that it lasts that bit longer with some work, some time and some TLC.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"> So. Here are a few weatherproofing tips to make sure your shed goes the distance. This is probably a job to do before winter, so your shed manages to survive the cold and damp months. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>1.</strong> Hopefully, when you erected your shed, you created either a hard standing or a gap between the floor and the ground, otherwise, it is very hard to stop water or damp creeping in from below. If you didn't do this before putting up the shed, consider raising your shed in some way. Perhaps on four evenly spaced waterproofed timbers, like joists beneath the shed, covered with a polyethene sheet and raising the shed just a few inches off the ground. These could be set in concrete or fixed together at each end creating a frame to stop them slipping in some other way. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>2.</strong> Check for holes and cracks. Go over the whole structure and if you can see light through anything but the windows, you have some work to do. Pay special attention to the fittings of the windows (if you have any) the joints, corners and places where the roof meets the walls. look for wet or damp patches.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">If your shed is a home-made Frankenstein's monster job (like mine) look at all the places where different woods have been used. You can patch any holes with new or reclaimed wood. since, as it is made of old bits anyway as you will hardly notice the difference. If your shed is too pretty to patch, you can use some kind of sealant or wood filler to plug gaps and fill holes. You can, of course, use a mixture of both these things just to make sure. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>3.</strong> If the roof is covered with roofing felt or another roofing material, check it has not been damaged and perhaps add a few more roof tacks to make sure the wind when it comes, does no damage. If it is tiled, check all the overlaps. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>4.</strong> Make sure your roofing felt or material comes right out over the edge of the shed and there is no curve where water can run down the roof, around and into the walls, or drip directly onto them as this will eventually rot the wood. Preferably fix up some guttering and a water butt.

Some people are not keen on bees at all. They may get in your picnic sandwiches, annoy you and you may be allergic to their stings but like it or not, as a species, humans really need the bees. If we had no bees, we would not survive long. They pollinate a massive percentage of the world's food (around a third) and crops and plants of all types depend on this pollination. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">The crops that bees are responsible for pollinating, and therefore keeping going, include apples, french beans, runner beans, broad beans, coffee, cucumbers, apricots, blueberries, peppers, walnuts, peaches and many crops that feed our dairy cattle. The list goes on and the result of losing all, or even some, of these crops, could be catastrophic.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Around thirteen species of bee are already extinct, with almost three times as many species under threat. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">So. Why not make your garden bee-friendly? Create an eco-system that suits bees and assist in growing the population. It will help the bees and might even help your growing efforts.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Where do you start?</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">1. Well, you <em>could</em> start by growing plants and flowers that attract the bees. For example, in the spring try viburnum, daffodils, pussy willow and crocuses are good, in summer poppies, sweet peas, delphiniums, and later in the summer Buddleia, dahlias, cornflowers, honeysuckle, lavender,  echinacea, broom, foxgloves and nasturtiums and fuschias from summer into autumn. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Not only do the bees like all these, we tend to like them too and what a great way to mix helping bees survive, with growing flowers that make us happy.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Herbs bees like, include sage, thyme, marjoram, borage and chives (though you need to let them flower) Letting some of these herbs flower, which many herb gardeners don't like, will not only encourage the bees. Used in cooking and salads the flowers of herbs are often more fragrant and delicious than the stems.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Other bee-friendly flora includes the highly scented Bergamot (sometimes known as 'bee balm' and comfrey (which makes great compost). </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">2. Don't use pesticides i</span><span style=\"font-size: small;\">n a bee-friendly garden,</span><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> It has been argued that the chemicals used in pesticides are the main reason for the decline in the bee population over the last decade. At the very least, limit your use and if you have any pesticides containing Neonicotinoids get rid of them, responsibly, as they are particularly harmful to pollinators, have been banned temporarily and are now on the way to being fully banned. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">3. Plant clumps of flowers in sunny spots, try to avoid shady areas as bees are less likely to pollinate there.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">You could allow a small part of your garden, or plot, to go wild, plant wildflowers from seed and let the grass grow a bit to provide shelter as well as food. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">4. Create temporary homes for bees. You don't have to build a hive and become a beekeeper, you can easily provide accommodation for bees in your garden. You can buy 'bee hotels' or make them by bundling together hollow stems or bamboo or even finding a log and drilling a number of deepish holes in it (around 2 - 10mm wide) and hang or place these at head height in a sunny, south facing area.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">You can also provide shelter from the weather for solitary bees by leaving some broken plant pots, with a way in, on the soil in shady areas. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">You can even create a wood pile with spaces in a corner of the garden that you let decay, that can become a micro-habitat for bugs including bees</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360001205292/Fotolia_84906109_XS.jpg\" alt=\"Fotolia_84906109_XS.jpg\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Bee Hotels</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">5. If you plant trees, think of bees. Bees like cherry trees, willow, plum and hazel trees. Holly bushes and hedges, apple trees and pear trees that produce a large crop of flowers are popular too. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">If you do all or just some of these things, you can make a bee friendly garden and help the bee population survive. Good luck. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"> </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"> </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>"},{"id":360000963931,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/360000963931.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360000963931-Simple-digging-methods-for-soil-preparation-","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":0,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200247777,"created_at":"2018-02-15T15:58:08Z","updated_at":"2018-02-21T12:47:41Z","name":"Simple digging methods for soil preparation ","title":"Simple digging methods for soil preparation ","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2018-02-21T12:47:41Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360001076572/Fotolia_157457084_XS.jpg\" alt=\"Fotolia_157457084_XS.jpg\" width=\"406\" height=\"271\"></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">If you are cultivating by hand, rather than using a mechanical rotavator, tiller or cultivator, there are a couple of methods you can use. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">1.<strong> Simple</strong> <strong>Dig and Drop. </strong>The simplest method of turning the soil over ready for the growing season, considered by some to be too simple, but often this and careful composting is all a plot needs. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">It involves simply digging up a large clod or chunk of earth, either turning it over and dumping it or putting it down, breaking up the earth in the hole you created and then popping the clod back, breaking that up after returning it. This works for some people, without the complexities of trenches and so on, but you have to be methodical about where you are digging. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">2. <strong>Single Digging. </strong>Like the dig and drop, this involves simply turning over the soil to the depth of your spade or fork. However, this method is more organised and structured. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Dig a smallish trench, perhaps about a foot or so wide (30 or more centimetres) and the depth of your spade or shovel, all along the length of your plot. Drop the soil from this trench aside, or in a container or wheelbarrow, so the trench remains empty. Then dig the same amount of soil from the same sized area next to it, tipping the soil, upside down, into the original tench and creating another. When you reach the end, the soil from the final trench goes back into the original trench (A tip - Deposit it in the barrow when you dig it out and wheel it back around to the original trench.)*</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">3. <strong>Double Digging. </strong>Only really applicable in Autumn or winter or when you are starting a new plot from scratch or when you need to enrich and deepen your topsoil or increase drainage</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Double digging, as the name suggests is, in essence, very like single digging (see above) but involves loosening <em>two</em> spade depths of soil from the trench, keeping the two loads separate then dropping one load back in turned over, followed by compost and manure, then the other load turned over. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">*<em>Alternatively, you can divide the plot into two large strips, either in your head or with canes and string and work up and down so you end up filling in the final </em>trench<em> with the soil from the end of the last strip. </em></span></p>"},{"id":360000916892,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/360000916892.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360000916892-A-simple-pre-gardening-warm-up-","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":0,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":360000217231,"created_at":"2018-02-14T15:51:49Z","updated_at":"2018-03-06T11:19:51Z","name":"A simple pre-gardening warm up ","title":"A simple pre-gardening warm up ","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2018-03-06T11:19:51Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127732,"label_names":[],"body":"<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360001011612/Fotolia_122910340_XS.jpg\" alt=\"Fotolia_122910340_XS.jpg\"></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">This simple warm-up is useful at any time of year, but possibly at it's most useful in the transition period from winter to spring, when the lethargy of lounging in an armchair, the cosiness of the divet and the fuzz of too many warming hot toddies may be taking their toll. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Getting out in the garden to start the year anew is a great experience but, all too often, is lurched into with the energy of an over-enthusiastic puppy, rather than eased into carefully. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">You can avoid back injuries and all sorts of stresses and strains by warming up before you get out there. Just like playing any sport a good warm-up is a fun and efficient way to avoid injury and build core strength into the bargain. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Make sure you are somewhere warm and comfortable, sober and alert before you do anything, exercises or work. Wear loose and comfortable clothing, with suitable support if you need it.  </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">So here goes.<strong>*</strong></span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Begin by gentle, deep breathing. Be aware of the air going in and out of your lungs and relax into it. Be aware of the sounds around you and the thoughts that come into your head but just let them come and go. There are no strict rules here.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Very gently shake your hands, arms, legs and feet to loosen them. Revolve your head gently around your shoulders in a circular motion a couple of times, and lift and drop your shoulders a few times. Then revolve your shoulders back and forwards. This will loosen your joints up a bit.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Gently sit and then lie down flat on the floor, on your back. Stay there for a moment, aware of the floor against your back and making sure your back is supported. If in doubt, about the small of your back, where there may be a curve or a gap, slip a pillow or cushion under to support yourself.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Gently lift your knees to your chest and wrap your hands around them as far as is comfortable. Hold this position for a count of sixty then gently let them down again. Relax.  Repeat two more times.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Slowly lift yourself into a sitting position and turn over until you are on your hands and knees. make sure your knees are comfortable in this position. If not, again, you could use cushions. Drop your head slowly to look at the floor then raise it gently until you are staring at the ceiling, staying on all fours at all time. DON'T force it, only go as far as is comfortable, we are NOT trying to build muscle or push too hard here. Do the head movement as many time as feels comfortable - probably four to six will do for a gentle warm up. </span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Raise yourself to a standing position. Standing up again, stretch out your arms to either side and revolve them slowly backwards and forwards. You can stretch them more by holding a rolled up, or scrunched up, towel over your head between your two hands.  Bring it behind the head, with one hand and then lower the other hand so it drops below shoulder height. Hold onto and very gently pull on the towel. Swap sides and repeat as many times as feels comfortable.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>*N.B</strong>. We must point out that these are only suggestions and that if you are concerned about exercise, have a heart condition or <em>any </em>other condition that may make exercising hazardous...don't. Go and seek medical help first. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">However, if you are of average fitness, a short and gentle warm-up is probably going to be of benefit.  </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"> </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"> </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"> </span></p>"},{"id":360000912572,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/360000912572.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360000912572-Look-after-your-back-some-tips-to-help-you","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":0,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":360000217231,"created_at":"2018-02-14T13:21:42Z","updated_at":"2018-02-14T16:02:30Z","name":"Look after your back - some tips to help you","title":"Look after your back - some tips to help you","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2018-02-14T16:02:30Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127732,"label_names":[],"body":"<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360001011551/Fotolia_166872038_XS.jpg\" alt=\"Fotolia_166872038_XS.jpg\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">Your spine is an incredible piece of natural engineering. It does a great deal of work, supporting your head, giving you core strength, responding flexibly so you can carry out a variety of different movements. But it needs looking after and protecting, even as you work. The same goes for your lower and upper back muscles. </p>\n<p>So many of the tasks we attempt in the garden, weeding, digging, hoeing, pruning, involve stretching, bending and lifting, all of which can cause back problems if not carried out correctly.  </p>\n<p>Wheelbarrows, strimmers, shovels, secateurs, and lawn mowers are all useful tools, designed to help us around the garden or plot. However, incorrect use of these tools, without proper technique and care and attention, can lead to long-term and problems, even permanent damage. </p>\n<p>So here are ten tips, designed to make you think twice before you bend rashly or throw yourself into a job. </p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Do a warm up.</strong> It may seem like overkill and we know you're not an Olympic athlete or a professional dancer, but any physical task from dancing on 'Strictly' to running for the bus can have an ill effect if you are not fit or properly warmed up, particularly in cold weather. Just ten to fifteen minutes of gentle stretching and<em> very</em> gentle bending, from your core, will make it so much easier. Think about what muscles and joints you will be using and give them a really gentle workout so they can take the impact of whatever task you are about to take on. </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Keep your back warm while working</strong>. When you have warmed up your muscles and back, keep them warm. Wear warm clothes, thermals if possible and make sure your lower back stays covered. Cap sleeved teeshirts and bravado have no place in the garden in cold weather. Obviously, if the sun is beating down, adjust your clothing but until it does, stay covered. </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Don't bend your back when lifting.</strong><em> </em>This advice is as old as the hills but it's remarkable how many people forget it. Don't pick up anything remotely heavy buy bending your back. Keep your back straight and bend your legs to take the weight. It's the law of levers. Your core strength should be created by squatting, using your stomach muscles, supported by your thighs and calves. The knees are the only joint where bending should happen. This even goes for lifting buckets of water or compost, concrete blocks and bricks, It is unwise to bend to pick anything heavier than a trowel unless you have to </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Think about your transportation.</strong> If you can use a wheelbarrow, fine (don't forget to bend those knees and not the back though). Just make sure it's a good one. However, there is nothing wrong with using some sort of mechanised garden trolley or cart. Powered barrows can be very useful if you have seriously heavy loads to transport across your property. If you have a ride-on with a tow hitch, you might think about a trailer for it. </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Have a good look at your garden tools.</strong> Are they old? Are they going to give you splinters or hand strain? More importantly, are they going to lead to back pain? You may have been bequeathed trusty old tools by your Granddad but modern tools are strong, designed for comfort and correct usage, keeping the body in alignment. They will, more often than not these days, be made with comfort grips and materials included to make working easier on your hands and body. Many tools now are ergonomically designed, lightweight but strong, with longer handles to keep you upright and protect your back,  shaped handles to help your hands and arms avoid strain. Think about purchasing ergonomic tools. Your spade, fork, rake or hoe are essential tools in the garden so make sure they are good ones.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Don't overstretch.</strong> Like trying to get those elusive, just out of reach blackberries, the ones that look so much better than the near ones,  it's very tempting to think you can stretch out and just reach that distant branch to prune it. but overstretching can cause some serious issues with your upper back, pulling or even tearing the muscles. Think about investing in some long reach pruners, loppers or hedge-cutters. </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Kneel to weed. </strong>Think very carefully about how you do your close up weeding. Don't bend unless you have to (see tip 3) Better to bring something comfortable to kneel on into the garden, either a dedicated garden kneeler, which will often have armrests or handles for support and to push up on when getting up, or a kneeling pad or even an old cushion. If your knees can't take it, think about an extended weeding tool. </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Take a break.</strong><em> </em>Like any job, achieving optimum efficiency in the garden can be helped by taking regular breaks and chopping and changing tasks regularly to avoid repetitive strains. Try to have a short break or a change of job about every fifteen minutes. This is more important with very arduous chores, will help your breathing and give your muscles time to recover.  </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Power cultivating</strong><em><strong>. </strong></em>if you have a lot of cultivating or digging to do and it seems a daunting task, it might be worth thinking about buying a powered tiller. These can be very affordable and could definitely help with the back strain issues.<em><strong>  </strong> </em>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Stay hydrated. </strong>Believe it or not, dehydration can lead to back pain, especially when you are working hard so DO make sure you have a good supply of drinking water with you, wherever you are working. Even on cold days, water is essential. Try to eat as well, so many people become exhausted by forgetting about meals in the garden or on an allotment and tiredness can lead to carelessness when working,  again risking injury on your back.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you follow these simple tips, you will have an easier, more enjoyable and, hopefully, back-pain free time in your garden or on your plot.

If you can, wear a helmet, gloves and, preferably, google, even grass can hurt your eye if it flies fast enough. Wear sturdy shoes, if you have steel te-capped shoes or boots, great! If your trimmer has a high DbA) then think about ear-defenders. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">2/ <strong>Use your harness.</strong> If your machines comes with a safety harness - please use it. Adjust and tighten it correctly so it's comfortable and secure to wear and so that the balance with the machine is good. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">3/ <strong>Prepare and damage proof your garden.</strong> Even the line of a trimmer can do damage or sustain damage if it meets an unusual obstacle. So check the area you are working on for obstacles in the area,  large rocks, bricks, wood, toys, or pint glasses from last years barbecue. Make sure any pets are in the house or out of the way and that small children are kept well beyond arms reach. It is also important these days to check for wildlife, toads, frogs hedgehogs or birds. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">4/ <strong>Stay sober and alert. </strong>As with any garden machinery, never use your line trimmer if you are over-tired, ill or under the influence of alcohol or medication.<strong> </strong>Try to fully concentrate<strong>, </strong>take regular rest periods or breaks and drink water. Stay hydrated. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">5/ <strong>Never use the trimmer in the rain or when the grass is very wet. </strong>This could be dangerous. If your trimmer is electric you could get a shock, you could slip  and you will also find your trimmer is not effective in very wet weather. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">6/ <strong>Keep your distance . </strong>Don't get too close to walls, garden ornaments garden furniture or trees<strong>. </strong>garden benches, trees or ornaments. You can wear line all too quickly if you are always hitting hard surfaces. Be very cautious and guide the trimmer near without touching, as if you were colouring in up to a line. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">7/ <strong>Take your time and make sure you know the cutting point.</strong> When you work with a line trimmer, the fastest moving and most powerful are of your line is the tip. This is down to centrifugal force. Therefore to get the best out of the line, and use the trimmer efficiently,  ensure the  strimmer head is placed in the correct position to utilise this, trying to use the tip to cut each time and not 'wading in' too far. If you go too too far into the long grass the line could slow down and even become tangled up with thicker, heavier foliage. Don't rush at it. It takes concentration and a measured, slow approach but will actually result in you getting the job done faster. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">8/<strong> Cut from right to left.</strong> Most, if not all, trimmer heads rotate right to left so cutting in this way ensures that the clippings fall back onto the already cut area. It is often useful to work in sections, making it easier to see what you are doing.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">9/ <strong>Don't just stick with one type of line. </strong>  Line types vary enormously. Some are lighter, some heavier, some thicker some thinner. If you use the right line for the right job you will, again, be efficient and save time and money into the bargain. Make sure you check the manual to see what type of line is usable.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">10/ <strong>Keep it clean.</strong> Always clean the trimmer after using it, focussing particularly on the trimming head. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">(If you have a metal blade, this should be cleaned and oiled after use)  </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">MowDirect carries a comprehensive range of <a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/brushcutters-strimmers-line-trimmers/petrol-brushcutters-line-trimmers\">petrol,</a> <a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/brushcutters-strimmers-line-trimmers/mains-electric-grass-trimmers-strimmers\">mains electric</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/brushcutters-strimmers-line-trimmers/cordless-linetrimmers-strimmers\">cordless battery powered brushcutters and grass trimmers</a>.

A border spade is predominantly a cutting instrument, designed to cut clean edges on your lawn, separating the lawn from flower or vegetable beds. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">While there is certainly some cosmetic value in nice clean, sharp edges, the value of this task reaches far beyond that.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Border spades can be used to create a border between the lawn and the beds, by digging trenches between the lawn and the bed , helping to prevent lawn grass taking over. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The cutting edge of a border spade is usually thinner and sharper than that of a classic spade, so </span><span style=\"font-size: small;\">You can use them to edge the lawn if you don't have an edger. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">It can also be used for edging grass pathways and for chopping out large roots. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">The border spade is very useful if you don't want to use a full sized spade, and is handy for work in raised beds or  confined spaces or beds, it can also be used for planting. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Finally, some people prefer border spades if they find classic spades or shovels too heavy and cumbersome. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Take a look at <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">our border spade range here. </span></span></p>"},{"id":360000156092,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/360000156092.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360000156092-Putting-your-Ride-on-or-Lawn-Tractor-away-for-the-Winter","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":0,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200387286,"created_at":"2018-01-19T13:52:54Z","updated_at":"2018-01-19T14:01:20Z","name":"Putting your Ride-on or Lawn Tractor away for the Winter","title":"Putting your Ride-on or Lawn Tractor away for the Winter","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2018-01-19T14:01:20Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360000168791/Fotolia_168535108_XS.jpg\" alt=\"Fotolia_168535108_XS.jpg\" width=\"497\" height=\"332\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">When the last cut has been done for the year, you'll be be putting away your tractor until the Spring.</p>\n<p>Before you do, here's a few tips just to make sure it's in tip top condition when you do get it out again.<br> <br><strong>PETROL:</strong> Take The petrol Out:<strong> </strong>When you use your petrol mower for the last time, probably around now, drain the petrol from your lawn mower. If you leave it in it may well not work next year as the ethanol in it may well separate and degrade. After you have siphoned the petrol off, run the engine until any last fuel in the pipes has gone.</p>\n<p><em>NB: Make sure you do this outside!</em><br> <br><strong>OIL:</strong> However, make sure the oil is topped up, fresh and full. Make sure you have the right oil and a good supply.</p>\n<p>Remove the spark plug and spray some WD-40 or similar into the holder. </p>\n<p>You could even change the spark plugs if you feel they have had sufficient use over the season.</p>\n<p><strong>CLEANING</strong>: Clean the Deck and make sure there is no dried or wet grass or mud on the blades or moving parts. Use a stiff wire type brush to get dirt off. Clean the wheels and perhaps grease or oil the axles</p>\n<p>If the cutting deck has a hose attachment, give it a good sluice then make sure it dries thoroughly.</p>\n<p>We recommend you clean the oil filters too, where accessible.</p>\n<p><strong>BLADE/S</strong>: Oil the blades perhaps and sharpen them if you can. This will help prevent rust.</p>\n<p><strong>STORAGE: </strong>Store your ride-on out of the rain, away from moisture and cover with a trapaulin, or dedicated tractor cover wherever possible</p>\n<p><em>NB make sure the ride-on is fully empty of petrol before you do anything with the deck.</em></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\">*  *  *</p>\n<p> </p>"},{"id":360000145612,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/360000145612.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360000145612-The-dos-and-don-ts-of-ride-on-and-lawn-tractor-safety","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":0,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":360000032012,"created_at":"2018-01-19T12:37:36Z","updated_at":"2018-02-14T15:04:44Z","name":"The dos and don'ts of ride-on and lawn tractor safety","title":"The dos and don'ts of ride-on and lawn tractor safety","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2018-02-14T15:04:44Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127732,"label_names":[],"body":"<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360000169592/Lawn_Tractor.jpg\" alt=\"Lawn_Tractor.jpg\" width=\"468\" height=\"322\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">Ride-on mowers and lawn tractors are practical and powerful machines and should be comfortable and enjoyable to use. However, like all machines, they need to be handled with confidence and respect and used carefully and safely.</p>\n<p>This list of dos and don'ts is designed to give you some quick and easy reminders to help you operate and enjoy your ride-on in safety. </p>\n<p><strong>DO</strong> read your manual carefully before use. This will include information on safety features.</p>\n<p><strong>DON'T </strong>fill up with petrol anywhere near a naked flame, including cigarettes, cigars or lighters </p>\n<p><strong>DO </strong>carry out regular and thorough maintenance. Unchecked and unmaintained machines are not just inefficient but also unsafe. Check your bolts, screws and keep all moving parts lubricated.Include all safety features in your checks.</p>\n<p><strong>DON'T</strong> dismantle or disable safety features. We know that cut-out switches and automatic stalling devices can seem like a bind. We get customers occasionally complaining about the lack of cutting when reversing, or objecting to the fact that that when they leave the seat on their ride-on the engine shuts down. While these may seem inconvenient these features are there for a very good reason. To protect the driver and anyone else around.</p>\n<p><strong>NB:</strong> <em>When customers talk about customising these features or disabling them we always have to say we CANNOT recommend this as it both creates potentially dangerous situations. It also automatically invalidates your warranty</em></p>\n<p><strong>DO</strong> make sure you are always fit, sober, alert and able to operate your ride-on. Even at the lower speeds at which you will be driving, you are still in charge of a large machine travelling at some velocity and, like driving a car, this is something that should only be carried out when you have all your wits about you. </p>\n<p><strong>DON'T</strong> cut your lawn at overly steep angles. We recommend a maximum of 15º tilt when cutting on slopes and our advice is to make sure you always cut across the slope, not bottom to top or vice versa. </p>\n<p><strong>DO </strong>make sure you shut the cutting mechanism (blades) down before you alight from the ride-on or lawn tractor. Even if there is no automatic cut-out it is always safer to power down even if it is for a short time. </p>\n<p><strong>DO</strong> make sure you keep your feet firmly on the decking of the ride-on when you are driving.</p>\n<p><strong>DON'T </strong>set off before checking all around you. Just like driving a car, being aware of obstacles and people, pets or animals around you is essential. This is particularly important when you are reversing of course. </p>\n<p><strong>DO</strong> wear sensible clothing. Sturdy shoes, ear defenders and a helmet are recommended. Goggles are advised and other clothing should be thick and hard-wearing.</p>\n<p><strong>DON'T</strong> allow children to operate or control the ride-on and it is advised that children also NOT be allowed to ride as passengers on lawn tractors. </p>\n<p><strong>DO</strong> make sure the engine is switched off and the ignition key is removed if you step away from your ride-on or lawn tractor, particularly if you are leaving it unattended for long periods.</p>\n<p><strong>DON'T </strong>forget to wrap up warm and keep warm if you are operating your ride-on in cold weather for any length of time. If you have a cup holder, try to have a flask of hot tea with you. Likewise, if you are working heat, make sure you are protected against the sun and drink water at regular intervals - stay hydrated. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\">* * * </p>\n<p> </p>"},{"id":360000112492,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/360000112492.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360000112492-Putting-Your-Mower-To-Bed-For-The-Winter","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":0,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200272478,"created_at":"2018-01-18T14:43:18Z","updated_at":"2018-01-18T15:42:52Z","name":"Putting Your Mower To Bed For The Winter","title":"Putting Your Mower To Bed For The Winter","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2018-01-18T15:42:52Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360000117212/Fotolia_58380761_XS.jpg\" alt=\"Fotolia_58380761_XS.jpg\" width=\"491\" height=\"328\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><em>Cover that mower</em></p>\n<p>When winter approaches, and it's time to store away your lawnmower, grass trimmer, scarifier or hedgetrimmer, don't forget to do it carefully. A lawn mower can be a big investment and, like any machinery, should be looked after properly to make the best of it. </p>\n<p>Whether your equipment is petrol, electric or cordless battery powered, it needs a bit of TLC and proper storage.</p>\n<p>We have seen our customers through many winters, so let us give you a few choice tips to make sure your precious mower, trimmer or tractor gives you as good service next season as it did this.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\">* * * </p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">All Machines:</span> Cleaning</strong></p>\n<p>After your last use, give the machine a thorough clean. Any build up of organic debris can hold moisture which can corrode metal.</p>\n<p>Make all blades are spotless and oiled. Lubricate moving parts, joints, hinges and engine parts.</p>\n<p>If your machine is mains powered, check and clean contacts.</p>\n<p>If it's a battery powered machine, remove the battery, and clean contacts.</p>\n<p>It is also a good idea to remove the battery from a petrol machine before storage and clean the terminals.</p>\n<p>N.B. If you have a petrol machine, empty your fuel tank before you clean or tip the machine.</p>\n<p>For more on lawn mower maintenance take a look at our MowHow pages.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\">* * * </p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Petrol Machines:</span> Fuel</strong></p>\n<p>Modern fuel usually contain ethanol which can spoil and do damage to your machine if left in the tank for long periods. So never leave raw, untreated fuel in your tank over the winter.</p>\n<p>Some experts maintain that draining your tank and leaving it empty can also cause problems, as a few drops will always remain and can spoil. However, anything is better than leaving untreated fuel in your tank.</p>\n<p>The best solution, once you have emptied the tank and cleaned the machine, is to mix fuel stabiliser with your fresh, unleaded fuel, following the stabiliser manufacturers instructions. This will keep the fuel from separating and make sure it is in good condition when you start up again.</p>\n<p>Fill the tank with the fuel/stabiliser mix, and run the engine for a few minutes to allow the stabiliser to go through the system. This should keep the fuel fresh and stable for up to six months.</p>\n<p>For more on oil and fuel, have a look at these articles on MowHow our knowledge base.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\">* * * </p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">All Machines:</span> Storage</strong></p>\n<p>Whatever power it uses, your mower, scarifier or strimmer should always be stored somewhere completely dry, cool and sheltered like a shed, storeroom or outhouse.</p>\n<p>Petrol machines should never be stored near a boiler, furnace or anything else with pilot lights or flames.</p>\n<p>Mains Electric machines should be stored with handles foled down and knobs loosened, cables neatly looped and, possibly, secured with a cable tie or even some string.</p>\n<p>Battery powered machines should be stored with the battery removed, wrapped and kept somewhere cool and dry. Do not store them in a very warm place as it can 'age' the battery and reduce performance.</p>\n<p>Batteries should be stored at around half charge for full efficiency when you come to use them again. As a safety precaution, they should not be stored resting on metal.</p>\n<p>If you can, cover and or wrap your garden machinery over winter, with a tarp, sacking or even an old sheet.</p>\n<p>For more on Lithium-Ion battery maintenance see <a style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https://mowhow.mowdirect.co.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/115002004231-Care-For-Your-Li-Ion-How-To-Get-The-Best-From-Your-Batteries\">this MowHow article. </a></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\">* * * </p>\n<p>Just follow these simple tips and your garden machinery should be ready to go when the new season starts.</p>\n<p>However, if you need any further information on keeping your mower or lawn tractor going, plus hundreds more articles and guides, pay a visit to our <a href=\"https://mowhow.mowdirect.co.uk/hc/en-gb/categories/200097543-Keeping-Going\">other pages on MowHow.</a><br> <br>And if you need anything else, call us on <strong>0345 4588 905.

And even if you overwintered your mower carefully, it's always a good idea to check and carry out a few TLC based tasks before the season starts.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">So here are some maintenance tips and a short list of ideas to help your mower cut it, even on the first attempt.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>NB:</strong> Do remember that you should wear sensible, protective clothing while carrying out many of these tasks.

This is the safest ways to carry out maintenance. Unless you replaced the plug before winter, put a new one in when you have finished.</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>-------------------------------------</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Contacts and Cables: </strong>(<em>Electric Mains Mowers Only</em>) Check all contacts are clean and undamaged.

Regular sharpening, at least once a year, is the only way to really keep it keen and prevent rough chopping of grass blades which can damage them and lead to a brown lawn.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Remove it from the mower first and ALWAYS make sure the power is off, the spark plug removed, the battery is out or the cable is unplugged.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">(If you wish, you can clean the inside of the deck with the blade off. it might be easier)</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">If your blade is damaged, this is a good time to replace it.</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>-------------------------------------</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Cleaning. </strong>Even if you cleaned it before the winter, now is a good time to check your mower is clean. If it is not, clean it thoroughly.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Any grass or mud in the deck should be removed as should any debris that has collected around the wheels. Use a hard bristled brush to get in and clean around the blade and axles.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Clean the outside too, wipe the outside of the deck with a damp cloth. Clean the handles and levers.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Clean out your grass catcher if you have one. You might as well start with as much space as possible.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Clean the air filters.

Quality tools will last you, will be more comfortable to use and will be reliable season on season. This isn't a sales pitch; pretty much every list of garden tools on the internet or in the gardening magazines will tell you the same.</p>\n<p>Look for good quality build and materials. If you are buying wooden tools, look for plain but sustainable, seasoned or weatherproofed material (paint and lots of decoration could be hiding a substandard wood).</p>\n<p>So here is a basic list of essential tools that any budding (sorry) gardener might need, with some hopefully useful illustrations and examples.  </p>\n<p>1. <strong>Gardening Gloves. </strong>It seems odd to put gloves top of the list but, seriously, if you don't get a pair of hand protectors PDQ the odds are you'll be cut, scratched or splintered within an hour or so of your first foray into the wild. This could you piut you off or even lead to infection. Minor injury hazards like thorns and prickles are an occupational hazard with gardening but are easily avoided.</p>\n<p>Good gardening gloves need to be tough but flexible. The gardening gloves illustrated here are tough, washable and breathable so they are comfortable to use. They are supple, hard-wearing and have a soft fleece lining for comfort and warmth. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115004177011/Town_Country_Gloves_MowHow.jpg\" alt=\"Town_Country_Gloves_MowHow.jpg\" width=\"370\" height=\"295\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\">Town and Country Premium Leather and Suede Gloves</p>\n<p>2.<strong> Digging Spade. </strong>Whatever you are going to do in the garden you will probably need a spade unless you have a patio with pots or a solitary lawn. You can shift earth, break up soil, dig holes, trenches and cut sod as well as lift and carry compost with this. </p>\n<p>A good spade should have a comfortable and easy to grip handle, a solid, robust and broad strong blade and a strong, good quality shaft that is a decent length. It should have a good sharpish edge for slicing through difficult roots and soil where necessary, but not too sharp to be safe. The example pictured has a sustainable ash wood handle and shaft. The average shaft is around 700mm (70cm/28\"). This example is guaranteed not to rust and carries a ten year warranty. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115004170971/1111111w-digging-spade_p3.jpg\" alt=\"1111111w-digging-spade_p3.jpg\" width=\"420\" height=\"420\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\">Wilkinson Sword Mirror Polished Stainless Steel Blade</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">3.<strong> Garden Fork. </strong>Another ubiquitous resident of every good garden shed, a quality digging fork will help you loosen and turn over soil, lift and break up clumps, lift out potatoes, and you can even use it to aerate your lawn if you have some time and a good supply of patience.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">Again you need a fork with a broad strong head and strong, long sharp tines for getting right into the soil. These tines should be solid, not be hollow or concave (if they are, don't buy it!) and the whole head should, ideally, be forged from one piece of metal. The handle will probably be D-shaped again for control and comfort and the shaft should be good quality, sustainable wood (this example is also ash wood, weatherproofed and sustainable.) The head on this example is carbon steel.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115004188232/1111201wr.jpg\" alt=\"1111201wr.jpg\" width=\"421\" height=\"421\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\">Wilkinson Sword Carbon Steel Digging Fork</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">4. <strong>Bypass</strong> <strong>Secateurs/Pruners. </strong>ideal for snipping and pruning bushes, roses, flowers, even small tree twigs, bypass secateurs or pruners make a neat clean cut as the blades pass each other. look for good quality blades and comfort grip handles, especially if you do a lot of pruning.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">Modern examples (like the example shown) will often have a central locking mechanism so you can use them with the left or right hand and lock it with one hand. The locking mechanism means you can carry them safely around the garden. The example shown has an effort-reducing spring mechanism and soft hand grips to reduce strain on the wrists and hands. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115004188832/rr2500.jpg\" alt=\"rr2500.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\">WoLF-Garten Medium Comfort Bypass Pruner</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">5. <strong>Trowel/Transplanter </strong>Whatever else you do, you'll be wanting to plant something at some stage. This is the bit that feels good and you will need to get up close and personal with the soil for this task, with a good quality planting and transplanting trowel, comfortable to hold and strong.  </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">The example we show here is the Wilkinson Sword Stainless Steel Transplanter. It's a very good quality trowel, ideal for planting bulbs and bedding plants in small spaces. It has an ergonomic natural ash handle, the tool head is constructed from from mirror-polished stainless steel and it is guaranteed no rust! </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115004198792/1111125w-ss-hand-transplanter_Small_MowHow.jpg\" alt=\"1111125w-ss-hand-transplanter_Small_MowHow.jpg\" width=\"370\" height=\"319\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\">Wilkinson Sword Stainless Steel Transplanter (Trowel)</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">6<strong>. Soil Rake. </strong>A good garden rake will help you clear debris from your soil. It should be sturdy with a long handle to avoid you having to bend down and a robust head with strong tines.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">The example shown is from the WOLF-Garten multi-change range. It is strong with 12 cold rolled steel tines, very durable and any length WOLF-Garten handle will fit it.<strong>*</strong></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115004173011/All-Purpose_Rake_small_MowHow.jpg\" alt=\"All-Purpose_Rake_small_MowHow.jpg\" width=\"338\" height=\"272\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\">WOLF-Garten Multi-Change All Purpose Rake Head</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">Other tools that will prove useful include a <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">hand fork</span>, <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">weeder</span>, <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">dibber</span>, a <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">water hose</span> <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">a trowel</span>, <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">knee pads </span>and more.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">You may become a lawn enthusiast and need <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">a lawn rake</span> or even move into garden machinery territory with <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">a scarifier</span>.

Well, old school iron and are generally heavy, prone to rust and early generation stainless steel tools are often just not really up to it any more.</p>\n<p>And as for cheap tools. If you buy super cheap tools you are definitely making a mistake. Cheap tools are unlikely to be be durable and can be detrimental to your comfort, your work and even your health. Weak cheap tool heads can bend, break and rust.</p>\n<p>Tools need strength and the toolhead is the business end of your tool. That means the fork tines, the blade of your spade, the point of your dibber, the blades of your secateurs.</p>\n<p>There are a variety of different materials used in good quality modern garden tools designed and engineered to deliver strength and durability.</p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><strong>Stainless Steel</strong></span></p>\n<p>WOLF-Garten garden tool-heads are generally stainless-steel, carefully made to offer strength and to avoid the problems of corrosion. Stainless steel is an alloy and contemporary stainless-steel alloys contain a higher percentage of nickel which is very hard and resistant to corrosion. </p>\n<p>There are also ranges of stainless steel tools from Wilkinson Sword, these tend to be  cultivation, digging and some lawn-care products. </p>\n<p><strong>Carbon Steel</strong></p>\n<p>Wilkinson Sword have a range of carbon steel headed tools. One range is mainly forks, shovels, weeders, rakes and so on. However, they also make scissors and cutting tools with top end carbon steel. </p>\n<p>Adding carbon to the steel means the metal stays sharper longer than stainless steel. It is also very hard wearing but can be a little more brittl, rather like cast iron.</p>\n<p><strong>Japanese Steel</strong></p>\n<p>Considered by many to be the best steel in the world, Japanese steel is, again, very strong and features in many tools from our Wilkinson Sword.  cutting ranges.  </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"> </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115004135192/WS_Ratchet_Loppers.jpg\" alt=\"WS_Ratchet_Loppers.jpg\"> </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\">Wilkinson Sword Ratchet Loppers with Japanese Steel Blades</p>\n<p>Many of Wilkinson Swords cutting blades are also coated with a non-stick substance so cutting is made easier and smoother. </p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><strong>Cold Rolled Steel </strong></span></p>\n<p>Cold rolling is a process whereby the steel is very near to room temperature when it is rolled out as opposed to rolling it at very high temperatures. it increases the strength of the steel by as much as 20%.

It is only going to affect and potentially damage, your back. Wouldn't an extended handle help? That's exactly the sort of question ergonomic designers ask themselves. </p>\n<p>Take another example. The standard length of a shovel handle is around 700mm (70cm/28\"), but not everyone is a standard height. Some people need longer handles so they don'r have to bend. Like this one at 850mm (85cm/33\") </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115004170651/D-HAndle_85cm_Small_MowHow.jpg\" alt=\"D-HAndle_85cm_Small_MowHow.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"206\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\">WOLF-Garten Multi-Change Aluminium D-Grip  Handle - 85cm</p>\n<p>So ergonomic designers look at all aspects of the tool and examine and adapt the angle, length, material and weight of the tool; the surface, handles, even tool-heads, to suit a more comfortable, safe and efficient way of working.  </p>\n<p>Take this WOLF-Garten Planting Trowel...</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/wolf-garten-lu2p-planting-trowel.html\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115004112711/LU2PPlanting_Trowel.jpg\" alt=\"LU2PPlanting_Trowel.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\"></a></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/wolf-garten-lu2p-planting-trowel.html\">WOLF-Garten Planting Trowel</a></p>\n<p>Note that, unlike that old trowel you have in the shed that belonged to your Great-Uncle and gives you splinters of you don't wear gloves, the handle on this fork is angled upwards, away from the blade. This is designed to ease stress on the wrist and make the digging movement more comfortable and efficient.</p>\n<p>Note also the grey inlaid panel on the handle, this is a soft-grip surface that eases the stress that can happen to the hands when they tightly grip a hard and cold surface.</p>\n<p>There are simple, soft, gripping dimples on the handle to make the tool non-slip as well. </p>\n<p>The shape of the handle is also designed to make working more comfortable and give you better control, and therefore allow you to work for longer and with more efficiency. </p>\n<p>These things are well worth considering when buying garden tools, as so many people become injured and sprains, strains and back, muscle and joint issues van often occur when gardening.  </p>\n<p>All of our ranges of hand-tools, WOLF-Garten and Wilkinson Sword, are thoughtfully designed.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115004134272/WS_Weeding_Fork_4_Mowhow.jpg\" alt=\"WS_Weeding_Fork_4_Mowhow.jpg\" width=\"349\" height=\"349\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\">Wilkinson Sword Long-Handled Weeding Fork</p>\n<p>So whether you decide on the more traditional style of Wilkinson Swords stainless steel or carbon steel digging and cultivation tools, garden tool ranges or the up to date look of Wolf-Garten tools and Wilkinson Sword pruning, trimming and cutting tools, you will find careful, user orientated  design is there across the board. </p>\n<p>If you want tom see more, why not take a look at our range of ergonomic, <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">easy to use tools here</span>. or have a look at some of the other articles in <a href=\"https://mowhow.mowdirect.co.uk/hc/en-gb/sections/115000889152-Hand-Tools\">this hand tools section. </a></p>\n<p> </p>"},{"id":115002593611,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/115002593611.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115002593611-Petrol-Powered-Rotary-Lawn-Mowers","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":0,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":115000668711,"created_at":"2017-11-06T16:54:42Z","updated_at":"2017-11-06T16:55:37Z","name":"Petrol Powered Rotary Lawn Mowers","title":"Petrol Powered Rotary Lawn Mowers","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2017-11-06T16:55:37Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127732,"label_names":[],"body":"<p> We want you to get the most out of your petrol rotary lawn mower, and enjoy using it from the beginning. </p>\n<p>Subsequently, we decided to create a basic guide, full of tips and advice, including answers to the types of questions new petrol rotary lawn mower owners frequently ask,  to save you time and give you confidence. </p>\n<p>That way you can get the best from your new purchase and use it efficiently and easily every time. </p>\n<p><strong>Assembly</strong>: Your new petrol rotary mower will arrive ‘boxed' and there is a minimal element of assembly. This is usually limited to attaching the 'Handlebars' and 'Grass catcher' .</p>\n<p><strong>Fuel:</strong> Your new lawn mower has a 4 Stroke engine, so Oil and Petrol are put in separate compartments, no mixing required.</p>\n<p>We understand manuals can be difficult to read from time to time and translations are not always as helpful as they might be. However, do try to read manual/instructions as thoroughly as you can and keep them to hand, at least during early use. </p>\n<p><strong>Petrol:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Modern fuel contains ethanol, which absorbs moisture and causes the fuel to deteriorate in as little as 30 days, causing damage and starting issues if left in the tank. Our suggested solution is either drain the tank if are going to leave it for a while or always add fuel stabilising additive to all fuel before filling up your tank.</li>\n<li>For the same reasons you should only put 'Fresh Unleaded Petrol' in your tank. Old fuel will degrade quickly if it has not already done so.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong> </strong><strong>Oil</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is important not to under-fill or over-fill your machine. Please refer to your manufacturers guidelines as to the quantity.</li>\n<li>Regular oil changes protect your engine from damage and excessive wear. Do refer to your ‘Engine’ manual regarding schedules for regular oil changes.</li>\n<li>Not all models come with oil in the box and none with oil in the tank. It is advisable to check and have some ready just in case. The type should be 10/30 Lawnmower Grade Oil, otherwise known as SAE 30.</li>\n<li>Oil needs to be changed after the first 5 hours of use. Running in of the machine can cause minute particles of metal debris in the engine, which an oil change and flush removes safely.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> <strong>Starting</strong> : If you are have difficulty starting your machine, it is always advisable to check the following: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure you are holding in the 'OPC Bar' (Operator Presence Control). If you are not holding this in you will be unable to pull out the recoil.</li>\n<li>If you have a 'Fuel Switch', please ensure this is on.</li>\n<li>If there is a 'Primer', check you have primed the machine.</li>\n<li>If there is a 'Throttle', check that this is fully on to start the machine and then reduce the throttle once the machine has started.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Throttle:</strong> Again, if there is a throttle on your model, do remember that it does not affect the speed of the machine, it simply reduces or increases the 'Revs' of the engine.</p>\n<p><strong>Storage:</strong> Petrol Lawnmower engines are not waterproof. So make sure you store yours in a dry place, covered if possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Grass and Mud: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wet and rotting grass causes metal components to rust and grass and dirt in or around the engine can cause overheating and damage. Always make sure you clean the cutting deck regularly and thoroughly.</li>\n<li>If your mower does not have a 'Deck Wash Port' (an attachment for a hose) you will need to tip the machine to clear the deck from beneath. Always tip from front to back so that the machine pivots/rests on the back wheels.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>NB</strong>: <em>Never tip from side to side as this causes the oil to flood the air filter.   This can contaminate your spark plug and carburettor</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Servicing</strong>: Don’t forget that Annual Servicing is recommended by the manufacturers and is a requirement if you want to extend the guarantee beyond the first year. Out of tune engines and blunt blades can result in poor cutting, poor collection, and environmental pollution.</p>\n<p>And finally, we’d like to thank you for your custom. We hope that these guidelines will be of assistance and that you enjoy using your new mower.

They have given users the opportunity to free themselves of cables and avoid fumes and noise by providing quiet, smooth power with minimum fuss and maximum efficiency.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"> But, just like any machines, batteries need looking after and there are some easy things you can do to keep your batteries going for the longest time at maximum efficiency.</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">First of all, try to keep your batteries at room temperature, around the 20°C mark. Extremes of heat particularly can rapidly age your Li-Ion batteries and stop them being effective. This means making sure you don’t store them near hot radiators, boilers and airing cupboards and not leaving them in a hot car or by a window. Similarly do not keep or store them in freezing conditions as, again, very cold temperatures can damage lithium-ion batteries. </span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><font size=\"2\">Do not store your batteries in a humid environment as condensation could damage them. </font></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Try not to run your battery to its absolute discharge before you charge again. A lithium-ion battery will operate best if it is partially discharged and re-charged regularly rather than waiting until the battery runs out. In fact, try not to completely discharge lithium-ion batteries at all as they can be hard to start it up again with a regular charger.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Lithium-ion batteries can be stored and re-used without discharge, but for best results when you store your batteries, for long periods, perhaps over the winter, try to make sure they are stored charged at around 40% as this will ensure maximum power return. Don’t charge them for long periods when empty or fully charged.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><font size=\"2\">For safety, when storing, try to make sure the batteries do not make contact with metal - a metal shelf for example - as batteries can seriously over heat if the terminals rest on metal. </font></span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Just keeping to these simple rules can add life to your batteries and save you time and money.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">For our exclusive range of popular, highly rated Lithium-Ion battery powered garden equipment, <a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/redback/redback-40v-cordless\">take a look here</a>.  </span></p>"},{"id":115003488206,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/115003488206.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115003488206-How-Do-I-Put-Stripes-On-My-Lawn-","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":0,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200246458,"created_at":"2017-07-11T14:39:30Z","updated_at":"2018-06-14T15:05:03Z","name":"How Do I Put Stripes On My Lawn?","title":"How Do I Put Stripes On My Lawn?","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2018-06-14T15:05:03Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115011632603/Fotolia_119331313_S.jpg\" alt=\"Fotolia_119331313_S.jpg\" width=\"544\" height=\"362\"></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">A smart and crisp striped lawn is as British as Blackadder, <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Wimbledon and Chicken T</span><span style=\"font-size: small;\">ikka Masala and lawn enthusiasts and sports ground-staff across the country, spend time and effort creating manicured, beautifully finished lawns. But what is the secret of a stripy lawn? How do you do it and what exactly gives that effect. If you are interested in striping your lawn there are some tips and answers to some of your questions here.</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>What Are The Stripes?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">The stripes are actually an optical illusion caused by the light hitting the grass blades in different ways.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>How Does It Work? </strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">When you flatten blades going one way and then flatten them coming back the other way, there is less the light reflected by the blades pointing towards you than reflected by the broad part of the blades directed away so one looks dark while the other looks light.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>So How Is It Achieved?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">It is simply a matter of flattening the grass in different directions. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Are All Stripes The Same?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">No. The heavier or more effective your flattening surface, the deeper and more defined the stripes. Also the more even and smart your cut, the better the stripes will look, so if you are interested in stripes, go for the equipment you can afford. And you can make more elaborate patterns, as made famous buy various football groundsmen in recent seasons. </span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115011489906/Fotolia_41650184_S.jpg\" alt=\"Fotolia_41650184_S.jpg\" width=\"374\" height=\"248\"> </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Is There Anything I Need To Do First?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Think about which direction the stripes are going to go. remember, as it's all down to light they will change in appearance as you move around the garden. Make sure the lawn is clear. Make sure you give it a good cut and perhaps edge round it first. Have a look to see if there are any lumps and bumps that need removing. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>How Many Different Methods Are Used To Create Stripes?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"> Within the basic principle of flattening grass blades, there are a number of different methods.</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Mow with a standard mower then roll the lawn with a push or towed roller</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Mow with a rotary mower with a striping flap</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Mow with a rear-roller rotary mower</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Mow with a rear-roller cylinder mower</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Mow with a rear-roller ride-on mower/lawn tractor</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Can You Give More Details About These Methods?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Yes. They are all very different and have their own benefits and disadvantages. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>1/ Mow with a standard mower then roll the lawn with a push or towed roller</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"> Mowing with a standard mower then pushing or pulling a mower by hand is certainly going to give you some exercise. Probably the most laborious of the methods, if you get a good cut to start with and have a decent, heavy, roller you can get very good results indeed and this is how bowling greens used to be finished before the invention of larger, heavy-rollered cylinder mowers. Iy you tow a roller with a ride-on you can also get good results but your turning circle is an issue to be addressed. Rollers lik,e the one pictured can be filled with water or sand to give you the weight and usually come with rolled edges for a smooth run and are often made from corrosion free material.

A cylinder mower works differently from a rotary mower. In a rotary mower, the cut is made by a circling horizontal blade. </span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115011633223/Allett_Rotary_Mowers_diagram.jpg\" alt=\"Allett_Rotary_Mowers_diagram.jpg\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Rotary Method</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">In a cylinder mower, the multiple blades are set into a cylinder that rotates forward in a clockwise direction.

What many people will think of at the mention of mulch is 'blanket' or 'carpet' style mulching. That is, laying down a protective layer, mainly organic material (but sometimes carpets, pebbles etc) spread out on the soil to keep it warm, protect it from frost, or cut down on the ingress of weeds. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">This is not wrong, but it is not the whole story. Mulching for the lawn is different , and involves the organised recycling of grass clippings to improve the health of your turf.</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>What is Mulching in Lawncare?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Mulching the lawn involves the double-cutting of grass, mowing then re-cutting within the deck to create much smaller grass cuttings which are then deposited into the lawn. Once in the lawn they will break down fats and help to fertilise the lawn. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\" style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong style=\"font-size: small;\">Why Should I Mulch?</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">The advantages of mulching are well worth considering. This process can be very beneficial, providing extra nutrients for the turf, creating a more beautiful, greener and healthier looking lawn. It is also a great way of recycling mowing waste. </span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">It also reduces cutting time, you don't have to be walking backwards and forwards to the compost heap with your cuttings, and if you believe in organic gardening it is a great way of using natural resources to improve the well-being of your lawn, and harvest the benefits of the nitrogen they produce rather than wasting them.  </span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">More and more people are considering mulching as part of a bio or ecologically sound approach to gardening, and to caring for the lawn. </span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"> <span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Do I Need Special Equipment?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Yes. You will either need a dedicated mulching mower or a mower that includes mulching as one of its features.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">The mulching process requires a specially shaped blade and, in dedicated mulchers, a special deck design to help keep the clippings moving around the blade. For this reason, dedicated mulching decks are often rounded and sealed, usually higher and roomier, allowing space for the clippings to move around and sometimes they have deflectors to direct the clippings.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">The decks and blades of dedicated mulching lawn mowers are designed specifically for this, with the decks creating the perfect airflow, and the right shaped blade to re-cut the clippings and push them down  rather than throwing them back or sideways and out. </span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/al-ko-460br-a-bio-self-propelled-mulching-lawn-mower.html\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115010634506/Screen_Shot_2017-06-27_at_16.jpg\" alt=\"Screen_Shot_2017-06-27_at_16.jpg\" width=\"352\" height=\"352\"></a></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/al-ko-460br-a-bio-self-propelled-mulching-lawn-mower.html\"><em>Al-Ko 460BR-A Bio Self-Propelled Mulching Lawn Mower</em></a></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>How Exactly Does The Mulching Process Work?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">See the diagram (below) The grass is cut but the deck shape keeps the clippings up in the air above the cutting-blades after cutting for the first time, then they drop and are re-cut, after which the vacuum created by the specially shaped blade forces the grass clippings downwards into the turf to break down quickly and provide nitrogen and phosphates, which permeate the soil to increase the health of the lawn.</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115010631746/mow_mulching_diagram.jpg\" alt=\"mow_mulching_diagram.jpg\" width=\"629\" height=\"187\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-small\"><em>How mulching works in a dedicated mulching mower</em></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Can I Mulch Without Using A Dedicated Mulching Mower?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Yes. There are lawnmowers that offer mulching as well as collection. A combi-lawnmower, often identified by offering 3-in-1, 4-in-1 performance, will offers grass collection and sometimes side-discharge as well as mulching, a kit is usually required, either with the mower or as an optional extra. </span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/oleo-mac-g53-tk-allroad-plus-4-self-propelled-lawn-mower.html\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115010634686/Combi_Mower_MowHow.jpg\" alt=\"Combi_Mower_MowHow.jpg\" width=\"352\" height=\"352\"></a></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/oleo-mac-g53-tk-allroad-plus-4-self-propelled-lawn-mower.html\"><em>Oleo-Mac 4-in-1 Combi Mower with Mulching Capability</em></a></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Which Type pf Mower Gives the Best Results?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Both a dedicated mulching mower and a combi mower with mulching facility will do the job. The best results, though, are probably going to come from a dedicated mulcher as the whole machine is designed from this task. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">However, notably, some mowers such as <a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/toro/toro-recycler-lawn-mowers\">Toro's Recycler</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/toro/toro-super-recycler-lawn-mowers\">Super Recycler ranges</a>, are designed primarily as mulching mowers with collection and /or side discharge as an option rather than the other way round where a primarily collecting mower has a mulch plug or kit.  </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"> Many of these models allow you to move quickly between mulching or collection at the flick of a switch.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>What Is In A Mulching Kit?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">The kit will usually contain the mulching blade, a mulch plug to prevent the clippings from being expelled through the grass exit channel and sometimes a deflector or deflectors that help direct the clippings in the deck so they can be re-cut before being deposited into the turf.*</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/lawnflite-pro-mulch-kit-71902-218.html\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115010766043/Mulch_Kit_For_Lawnflite_Pro_MowHow.jpg\" alt=\"Mulch_Kit_For_Lawnflite_Pro_MowHow.jpg\"></a><strong> </strong></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/lawnflite-pro-mulch-kit-71902-218.html\"><em>A mulch kit for a Lawnflite-Pro</em></a></span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>In What Way Are The Blades Different?</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">If you look at the mulching blade (A)  compared to the conventional cutting blade (B), you can see the difference.

Mulching mowers com in many shapes and sizes, just as conventional cutting mowers do. There are push, self-propelled and mulching ride on mowers and lawn tractors. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>How Often Should I Mulch?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><em>Y</em>ou should Probably mow once a week (leave 7 days between) during the cutting season. You don't want to over cut or damage the grass so no more than this and any longer the grass will start to grow too tall for the volume of clippings.  </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Should I Cut To The Same Height As When I Am Collecting? </strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">No.<em> </em>You need to make sure the grass is left about 1.30cm (half an inch approx) longer than you would leave it for collecting. However, as you will be advised whatever mower you use, don't cut more than a third off your grass at a time. This helps root growth and hides the clippings in the grass.  </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">However, don't let your lawn grow much above 8cm (3ins) if you are mulching. The clippings need to be buried in the lawn and there would be too high a  volume of clippings for this to work. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Do I Need To Do Any Extra Maintenance with My Mower? </strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Yes. Mulching will blunt blades quicker than regular mowing due to the amount of time the blade makes contact with the grass in each cut. You will, therefore, need to sharpen blades more often if you are mulching. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">You should also make sure you keep your deck clean. All mower decks need to be kept clean to stop rotting grass causing damage and with mulching mowers those finely cut clippings can get everywhere.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">I've Heard That Mulching Can Lead To An Increase in Thatch?</span></strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">There is no evidence for this. Thatch is mainly caused by grass blades, which don't rot, dying and falling within the grass plants</span><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">, gradually filling up that space. The clippings you are putting in the grass will break down very quickly and will not lead to thatch. In fact, by putting more nitrogen into the grass you are helping the lawn feed more efficiently not choking it. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Is There Anything Else I N</strong><strong>eed To Do? </strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Yes. If you are going to water the lawn, you are better off doing it after you cut, never before. It is easier to cut and spread dry clippings in the lawn than wet ones. For this reason, also, as mentioned before, it is advisable to mulch cut your lawn on dry days and after the morning dew has dissipated. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Can I see Some Mulching Mowers?</span></strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">MowDirect carry a large range of mulching mowers, from the dedicated models to the 3-in-1 and 4-in-1 and from hand-propelled mowers to mulching ride-on models as discussed earlier. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Take a a look here to see some of our<a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/lawn-mowers/petrol-lawnmowers/petrol-four-wheel-rotary-lawn-mowers/self-propelled-4-wheel-petrol-lawn-mowers/all-deals-4052/lm-filter-cutting-options/mulcher\"> dedicated mulchers</a> or here to see some of <a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/lawn-mowers/petrol-lawnmowers/petrol-four-wheel-rotary-lawn-mowers/self-propelled-4-wheel-petrol-lawn-mowers/all-deals-4052/lm-filter-cutting-options/collect-and-mulch\">our combi machines</a></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">However, if you do need further advice, just call our product advisors on <strong>0345 4588 905</strong></span><strong> (9am-5pm Mon-Fri 10am-4pm Sat). </strong>They are friendly, helpful and know their stuff. </p>\n<p>“<em>Excellent Product and Outstanding Service . The advice I received from MowDirect was spot on and this product was perfect..\" </em>PAUL</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong> * NB. </strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-small\"><em>It is not essential to use dedicated mulch blades with a combi-mower.  You can only mulch grass at very short lengths so you need to cut and collect the grass first, then put in the mulch plug and go over the grass again to mulch. If you regularly use the machine on the mulch setting the grass is kept so short that the cut and collect first is unnecessary. Our UK weather means that optimum mulching conditions (very dry grass) are probably only possible about 4 weeks so we recommend keeping on the combo-blades that come as standard with the machine. these still work as they are designed for this purposes. If you want to use dedicated mulching blades you ned to take the cutting blades off  then put mulching blades on, then use the machine, then remove mulching blades and put the normal blades back on. </em></span></p>"},{"id":115003138426,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/115003138426.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115003138426-Do-I-Need-a-Scarifier-","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":0,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200246458,"created_at":"2017-06-23T13:24:14Z","updated_at":"2018-03-20T11:19:00Z","name":"Do I Need a Scarifier?","title":"Do I Need a Scarifier?","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2018-03-20T11:19:00Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115010538803/Fotolia_40155736_S.jpg\" alt=\"Fotolia_40155736_S.jpg\" width=\"501\" height=\"333\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><em><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">A scarifier in action</span></em></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Most lawns, at some time or another, will benefit from scarifying. This process can help your lawn breathe and leave it looking greener and more healthy.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Perhaps your lawn is feeling rather springy or spongy? Perhaps there are yellow patches, perhaps the lawn is not draining well and puddles form? If so it is probably a build up of thatch.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"> All lawns at some stage will be prone to this and some raking or scarifying at the right time, and with the right equipment can be very beneficial to your lawn’s health.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>What Exactly Is Thatch?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Thatch is organic material that has built up amongst the grass plants of your lawn. A lawn, of course, is made up of individual plants, about 850 per square foot (approximately 0.093 sq metres ).</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Basic thatch is actually the result of normal lawn growth. Grass contains a substance called ‘lignin’ which means that plants die and fall, as part of their life cycle, but they don’t rot. They stay inside the lawn and build up as new young plants grow.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Water, air and sunlight provide the nourishment and conditions the lawn needs to grow and be healthy, the thatch can start to choke the new growth and prevent the air, water and sunshine from getting through.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">When thatch reaches a thickness of more that around half a centimetre to 1 centimetre 30, it really starts to become a hazard for the new growth, in effect choking the lawn and preventing it from flourishing.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Tip</strong><em>: Get down and look closely, if you can see a lot of dead, yellow material in there, that is thatch. </em></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\" style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong style=\"font-size: small;\">Is Thatch The Only Problem?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">No. Other organic material, dead weeds, moss and so on can also build up in your lawn, also making it difficult for the turf to thrive. Also, soil compaction can also prevent the lawn growing and thriving. Scarifying can help with this too. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Why Don’t I Just Use an Aerator?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">An aerator, while it does a very useful and, some would say vital, job, will not remove anywhere near as much organic material. Aerators concentrate on creating holes for letting air and water in, helping stop the effects of compaction and some of the symptoms of thatch, whereas a scarifier carries out both these tasks and removes a lot of material,  stopping the thatch blocking growth.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>So What Exactly Is Scarifying?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Scarifying could be described as deep raking. Running a rake across your lawn will remove some organic detritus but scarifying will remove a lot more. As one of our customers points out…</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">“<em>The amount of moss and thatch ripped up on the first two passes on the highest setting was incredible...manual raking was getting nowhere</em>” ANDREW</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Scarifying involves penetrating the lawn with blades that cut into the turf and remove large amounts of organic material. In the process they leave holes in the ground that enable more air and water to get into the grass and the soil.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>How Do I Scarify?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Well, as mentioned before, you can carry out a basic process with a sprung lawn rake. However, this is not really scarifying, won't remove much thatch at all and will be limited in its success. So for the best results a mechanical scarifier of some sort is definitely a good option.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>How Does a Scarifier Work?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Steel blades are set into a roller in a wheeled machine so that as you propel the scarifier forward penetration occurs at regular intervals. The blades revolve forwards and clockwise so the organic material is left behind.</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115010402466/Scarifier_Internalshot_MowHow.jpg\" alt=\"Scarifier_Internalshot_MowHow.jpg\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Scarifier - How It Works</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">There will usually be choice of height settings so can regulate how deep you need your scarifying to be and better versions will have wide-tread wheels to make sure you do no damage to the turf as you work.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>What Sort of Scarifiers Are Available?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">There are many types available, from towed models to mains electric and petrol versions and nowadays a growing number of powerful battery powered scarifiers. Some are hand-propelled and some are propelled to make the work easier and faster.</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/einhell-gc-sc-2240p-petrol-lawn-scarifier.html\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115010402586/Petrol_powered_Scarifier_MowHow.jpg\" alt=\"Petrol_powered_Scarifier_MowHow.jpg\"></a></span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><em><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/einhell-gc-sc-2240p-petrol-lawn-scarifier.html\">The popular Einhell GC-SC 2240P Petrol Lawn Scarifier</a></span></em></span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\" style=\"font-size: small;\">You will also find combi scarifiers that include both an aerating and a scarifying device, offering 2-in-1 lawn care. At certain times of year you will not need to scarify and can simply aerate.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Will I See Results Quickly?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">No. Probably not. In fact you may feel as though you have done something foolish when you have finished. This is normal. The process of scarifying can leave your lawn, initially, looking pretty ragged.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">“<em>The result obviously looks fairly devastating while we wait for the grass to start growing but many barrow-loads of moss and thatch were effectively removed so I am very pleased</em>” ROGER</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">This is, of course, dependant on how much of your lawn is taken over by thatch or moss. Most people who buy a scarifier for the first time are a little bit shocked, but remember, this is freeing up the lawn to grow again and to be free of the clogging effects of moss and thatch.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Do I Need To Do Any Preparation Before Scarifying?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Yes. The grass should be short so if your lawn has long grass start cutting it down in stages a couple of weeks before you start.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">If you have obvious weeds try to get rid of them first and make sure there are no obstacles, large stones etc in the grass as you would do if you were mowing.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Check the lawn’s moisture content before you start. Don’t scarify if it is dewy, it is probably better to wait until later in the day.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>When Should I Scarifiy?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">It really depends. Light scarifying, not going too deep, is beneficial, generally in late spring from somewhere around the middle of April to June and in late summer early autumn, around late August to September.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Heavier, more aggressive scarifying is possible in the Autumn (again think Late August early September, maybe even early October depending on weather conditions).</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Bearing in mind the earlier mention of how your lawn might look after you have finished scarifying, this is a is good time, as you are less likely, having taken your lawn apart, to have problems with weeds seeding and filling in the spaces you have left in the lawn.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">However, if you have a lot of shade in your garden, trees, large bushes etc, you might find autumn is not so good as the grass will be a little thin at that time.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Should I Scarify In Winter?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">In nearly all cases, NO. It is all to do with the weather and the moisture that is around. The best conditions in which to scarifiy is when there is some moisture on the ground but it is not wet and not too dry.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Trying to scarify a lawn that is wet can leave a real mess and cause damage to the lawn, and trying to dig into a lawn when it is cold and frosted and the ground hard can also do serious damage. It is generally best avoid trying to scarify in January and February altogether.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>What Should I Do With The Detritus I Remove?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Most scarifiers come with collection boxes or bags like a lawn mower. However, in my experience scarifiers seem to take out much more material than most grass collection boxes can handle.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Most first time scarifier owners are seriously amazed, even shocked, by how much they can remove.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><em>“I could not believe the amount of moss that it cleared” </em>ARNOLD</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">If there is too much for your collection bag and you don’t want to keep emptying, remove the bag and let the material fall to the lawn. Then just rake it up and put it on the compost heap. DON’T leave it on the lawn.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">And don’t forget, MowDirect carries a great range of scarifiers of all kinds. <a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/lawn-care/aerators-and-scarifiers/as-filter-style/scarifiers-lawn-rakes\">You can see the whole range here.</a></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">And if you need more advice and guidance, just call our product advisors on <strong>0345 4588 905 (9am-5pm Mon-Fri &amp; 10am-4pm Sat) </strong>We are proud of our product knowledge.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"> <em>“Excellent Product and Outstanding Service</em>. <em>The advice I received from MowDirect was spot on and this product was perfect\" </em>PAUL</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"> </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"> </span></p>"},{"id":115003103366,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/115003103366.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115003103366-Do-I-Need-a-Lawn-Aerator-","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":0,"vote_sum":1,"vote_count":1,"section_id":200246458,"created_at":"2017-06-21T15:16:17Z","updated_at":"2020-08-03T16:17:55Z","name":"Do I Need a Lawn Aerator?","title":"Do I Need a Lawn Aerator?","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2018-05-27T14:44:26Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/billy-goat-l2500h-plugr-aerator-honda-engine.html\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115002920092/Billy_Goat_Aerator.jpg\" alt=\"Billy_Goat_Aerator.jpg\" width=\"321\" height=\"310\"></a></span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><em> <a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/billy-goat-l2500h-plugr-aerator-honda-engine.html\">Billy Goat Plug Aerator (Honda engine)</a></em></span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Next time you are in your garden, take a good look at your lawn. Is it green? Is it lush? How does it feel? Springy? Firm? Does it seem healthy? Are you sure?</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Whatever you feel about your lawn, there are often issues hiding around the corner that you haven’t even considered.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Thatch building up under the surface, soil that has not been irrigated properly, maybe ground that has become compacted and impenetrable.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Your lawn will thank you for doing something about this. Just a run over with the old mower every couple of weeks isn’t enough if you want a lawn you can be really proud of.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">This is why more and more people who want a good, healthy lawn are investing in extra lawn care equipment like aerators and scarifiers.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">In this article, we will be dealing exclusively with aerators, but there are <a href=\"https://mowhow.mowdirect.co.uk/hc/en-gb/sections/200298903-Aerators-and-Scarifiers\">articles on scarifying elsewhere</a> in this knowledge base.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Thatch and weeds and moss built up in the lawn stop water, oxygen and nutrients reaching the grass roots. Hard compacted soil will do much the same, preventing the lawn from being fed and watered and affecting its health and colour.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong><u>How To Identify Lawn Problems Where Aeration May Help </u></strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong><u>1/ Compaction</u></strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">The easiest of these issues to work out is probably soil compaction. This is very common. All lawns will be compacted to some degree. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Lawns are walked on played on, rolled on, have wheelbarrows wheeled over them. footballs kicked all over them and are generally part of your outdoor space so, like a carpet they need some TLC from time to time.</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115010329146/Football_Compaction_MowHow.jpg\" alt=\"Football_Compaction_MowHow.jpg\" width=\"362\" height=\"242\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><em>Compaction 1 - Lawn 0</em></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Gardens with heavy clay soils are more prone to compaction and therefore are will probably have some issues with water retention and drainage. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">So test your soil. If it is heavy clay soil then it is highly likely that your lawn will benefit from aeration. If your garden has medium to heavy traffic, it will probably benefit from aeration.  </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong><u>2/ Water Run-off</u></strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">If you have any steepish slopes as part of your lawn this can be a problem. Sloped lawns are hard to keep irrigated as the water can often run away, reducing the amount that gets to the roots of the grass plants. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong><u>3/ Thatch</u></strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">If your lawn feels over springy, spongy or has brown patches that are not linked with lack of rain or watering, there is a good chance you have an excessive build up of thatch.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">You can check this by extracting a sample down to soil level a few inches down. If there is more than a centimetre to a centimetre and a half of organic material under the grass this could be a problem.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><em> </em>So. To recap, slopes, compaction and a build up of unwanted organic material and thatch can all affect your lawns health, blocking nutrients and reducing water and oxygen intake. Look for symptoms of the lawn drying out and</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Aeration can help solve these problems, letting the lawn ‘breathe’ again and helping more water and nutrients get into the soil and grass roots, making them stronger, longer and more likely to flourish so your lawn looks, feels and is healthier.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Tip: </strong><em>Try sticking a pencil or similar into the soil. If it is a struggle to penetrate, this is a sign that there may well be compaction or a proliferation of thatch. </em></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Other Symptoms </strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Water collecting, or puddling, on your lawn may well mean drainage issues which could be solved by aeration. Lawns may dry out as a result of thatch taking the majority of the water so patches of thinning or undeveloped grass may mean thatch or compaction.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Is Aeration The Answer?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Aeration can help solve these problems, letting the lawn ‘breathe’ again and helping more water and nutrients get into the soil and grass roots, making them stronger, longer and more likely to flourish so your lawn looks, feels and is healthier and more robust. It is easy to carry out and well worth the effort.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong><u>So What Precisely Is Aeration?</u></strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Aeration is the process of opening up the turf across the lawn, making holes at regular intervals that loosen compacted soil, cuts through thatch and allows the air and water in.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong><u>How Do I Aerate? </u></strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">You can walk over the lawn with a fork and create holes, but regulating the holes and obtaining full coverage is tough, particularly if your lawn is expansive or you have several lawns. It also takes a fair amount of time and physical effort </span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115010328006/Fotolia_39213142_XS.jpg\" alt=\"Fotolia_39213142_XS.jpg\" width=\"351\" height=\"234\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><em>Aeration the hard way</em></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong><u>How Else Can I Do It?</u></strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">More and more gardeners and lawn enthusiasts are using wheeled, mechanical aerators, which use metal tines, or blades, usually revolving on a spool to create small, regular holes into the lawn.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong><u>What Aerators Are There on The Market? </u></strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Aerators come in all shapes and sizes. Hand propelled, self-propelled, towed, battery-powered, petrol powered or mains electric powered and can even be towed behind a lawn tractor.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Do They All Work The Same Way? </strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Not quite.

They are easy to use, probably easier than hollow tine aerators as they don’t need to punch as deep and need less weight or power to penetrate the turf.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">That being said, solid tine aerators are sometimes seen as a more temporary fix and you will probably have to use one more than you would a hollow tine aerator.

So here are a few tips to get you going.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">For the purposes of this article We’ll assume you are just going to create one large plot, rather like many allotments, if you want to create more, great but be careful, it can be addictive.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Location, Location Location</strong></p>\n<p>Vegetables, in general, are a bit like party-going holidaymakers flocking to Ibiza. They are looking for lots of sun and a decent drink. Crops need as much sun as they can get. We are not always lucky with this in the UK but the more they get the healthier, stronger and tastier they will be.</p>\n<p>Subsequently, there is no point setting out your vegetable patch in the shade of the old oak tree or right in the shadow of the house or your garden shed unless you have no choice. So find a good spot in your garden that gets the most sun and will also get a good soak when it rains.</p>\n<p>People often make the mistake of setting plots near a shed to provide shelter but the benefits of the sun outweigh the windbreak effect. It is better to keep the wind off your plants using hedges, fences or other windbreaks than plunge the patch into shadow. Some crops such as strawberries, tomatoes and other salad providers do need a bit of shade but netting, fencing and so on can provide this.</p>\n<p> <span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>All Clear</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">So. You know where it is going to be. You know how big it's going to be. Now you have to turn the patch of grass you have chosen into a cultivatable plot. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">It is essential to remove any perennial weeds first (including brambles, dandelions, nettles, couch grass, bindweed) as they are very tough and difficult to get rid of and you don't want them setting up home in your newly cultivated bed. I would dig them out. Some people are happy to use chemicals, I am not, but ultimately it is your decision.  Another way is to cover the ground with black plastic sheeting/carpet or the like until the weeds die and then remove them and turn over the ground. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">If you don't have a major weed problem in your lawn, you could just cut and lift the turf, stack it for compost (it will create good compost after breaking down) and then turn over the soil, underneath. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">The soil turning can be done either by hand or mechanically. If you want to know more about mechanical <a href=\"https://mowhow.mowdirect.co.uk/hc/en-gb/sections/200299593-Cultivators-Tillers-and-Rotavators-\">tillers or cultivators, there is more information</a> on these pages. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Soil Type</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">You can’t do much about the soil that lives in your garden unless you are interested and rich enough to get into importing award-winning soil from Tuscany. However knowing your soil type is pretty important and once you worked that out, there are some things you can do.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Here are a couple of examples.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">If your soil is very thin, sandy soils are difficult to grow in. You will know this kind of soil as it will feel gritty, will often have multitudes of stones and dries out very quickly, even after rain. It can be helped along with lots of organic material like leaves, grass cuttings and so on.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">If you have the opposite problem, i.e. heavy, clay type soils, you will need to try to aerate it and loosen it with very well broken down organic mulch.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Whatever else you do with your soil, do feed it with natural organic compost and fertilisers These contain potassium, phosphorous and nitrogen, all of which are vital for the cultivation of healthy plants.</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/115002221846/Fotolia_107992700_XS.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"435\" height=\"290\"></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Compost</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Keep a proper compost heap to provide free broken down material and never waste a cabbage leaf, a mouldy tomato or a banana skin again. This compost will be a great ally in keeping your soil productive.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Water Water Everywhere</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">If it doesn’t rain, don’t forget to water the soil. A decent natural water collection system will help so water you don’t need when it rains is collected for when you do need it. Then when the hosepipe bans come in, you won’t be affected quite so much.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Raising the Bed</strong> </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">If your soil is of the heavy clay variety, raised beds could well be your salvation. This type of soil is harder to warm up so raising it takes it away from the ground. They are also easier on the back and help fight off slugs and other pests, make for better aeration and drainage. Worth a thought.</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/115002219703/Fotolia_109140279_XS.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"445\" height=\"296\"></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Get Cultivated</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">You will need to cultivate your soil, that is turn the soil in your bed/s over in preparation for planting. This will also loosen and cut up weeds, which you can then dispose of. Traditionally this is done with a fork and/or spade but more and more gardeners are turning to mechanical tillers and cultivators. It is your choice, but before you decide do be aware that petrol tillers give off fumes and are noisy electric tillers can have long unwieldy cables and battery tillers may or may not have the power you are looking for. If you want to see some tillers and cultivators and think about your choices,  <a href=\"https://www.mowdirect.co.uk/cultivators-tillers-rotavators\">there is a wide range on these pages</a>  and if you want to know more about these machines, take a look here in <a href=\"https://mowhow.mowdirect.co.uk/hc/en-gb/sections/200299593-Cultivators-Tillers-and-Rotavators-\">their MowHow section. </a></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Weeds</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">You will need to do a very good and through weeding session or two before you start. The clearer you keep your bed now the better it will be and every weed you remove means more nutrients, water and space for your precious veggies.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Cover your plot in early Spring to discourage weeds. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Divide and </strong><strong>Conquer</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">All beds, even a smallish bed, should be divided for access and for ease of identification and for plot rotation purposes (moving crops around each year to keep the soil clean and keep pests and disease down to a minimum. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">These divisions should be divided by paths. If you can use stone or paving stones, great, if not stamp and compact the soil between the growing areas. This is so snails, slugs and other pests will have a hard time, can be picked off by birds as they try to cross between one sub-bed and another and also so it is easier for you to reach plants and crops as you go. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">The paths should be a decent width, otherwise, crops will start encroach on them and start to tangle and you won't be able to tell your courgette plant from your strawberries. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>What to Grow?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Ultimately that is up to you. It all comes down to taste but, if you are dedicated to providing a quantity of delicious homegrown food there are a few interesting points to consider.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Think about what is easy to grow in your soil and conditions. Are you really going to grow a huge crop of sweetcorn in that dry sandy soil? Probably not. </span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Look at what is abundant, tasty and cheap in the shops. main-crop potatoes take up a lot of space and are regularly well priced so is it worth it? or does the idea of your own new potatoes cooked an hour after being dug up appeal too much?</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Think about how long something takes to grow and how much harvest it actually provides. Is it worth growing savoy cabbage when your local greengrocer provides them at a decent price every week?</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Plants known as 'cut-and-come-again' are very rewarding as you can get a meal from say, a lettuce or pak choi, and another few days later.  </span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">There is no such thing as 'a tomato' what there are is thousands of varieties of tomato. There is not room here but look into varieties, how long they take to grow, what characteristics they have. This could increase your crop and decrease your work. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Finally, stick with it. There is a point in putting together a plot when it all seems like too much but, if you persevere, the rewards can be... well... delicious. </span></p>"},{"id":115000831966,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/115000831966.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115000831966-What-is-scarifying-","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":0,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200298903,"created_at":"2017-02-16T12:06:51Z","updated_at":"2022-03-08T11:25:13Z","name":"What is scarifying?

As the new shoots grow these defunct shoots drop beneath the surface of the lawn. However, these dead shoots do not decay, due to a polymer present in their molecular make-up. This means they build up and can choke a lawn. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">it is easy to tell or to work out if you have a thatch problem.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Your lawn may feel excessively springy and bouncy</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Look carefully at the lawn. Can you see any soil between the grass?

Service. </strong></strong>Einhell's size, financial stability and presence in the marketplace, along with their many partnerships, mean a great level of after-sales service, whatever your issue.</p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/204481163/Einhell_Telephone_Frau_MowHow.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"361\" height=\"257\"></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\">Einhell after-sales service with a smile</p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><strong>4. Unique Design. </strong>Einhell's designers work very hard to make their products distinctive and stylish. This design goes hand in hand with the afore-mentioned ergonomics to create stylish and comfortable tools for everyday use. </p>\r\n<p><strong> 5. Ergonomics. </strong>Einhell's belief in ergonomics is devoted to creating comfort and ease of use for the customer so causing less stress and strain. This is not is not a trend or a fad. This concentration on ergonomic design, making the machine to fit the human, goes back a long way and, as you would expect, a German company like Einhell is at the forefront. Think about their vibration brushcutters for example. These are designed to make life easer for the user. They do it very well. </p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/204480963/Einhell_Pruner__MowHow_Shot.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"417\" height=\"226\"></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\">easy pruning with Einhell</p>\r\n<p> MowDirect has a number of exclusive deals with Einhell and we are very excited about the future, including Einhell's development of powerful battery technology.  </p>\r\n<p> </p>"},{"id":209185226,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/209185226.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/209185226-Freedom-48-Petrol-Power-Cordless-Convenience-Watch-The-Short-Film","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":0,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":201994103,"created_at":"2016-06-06T11:07:36Z","updated_at":"2016-06-07T09:22:15Z","name":"Freedom 48.

And long lasting. A Chainsaw is an investment so it should perform well for more than one season.</p>\r\n<p>The designers and engineers at Oleo-Mac know this, and their work leads to machines will will stand up to hard work season in and season out, with great performance, safe and easy operation and good features.</p>\r\n<p>So. Here are five good reasons why you should choose an Oleo-Mac saw.</p>\r\n<p>1. <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><strong>Build Quality</strong></span>. Oleo-Mac Chainsaws are rugged and built to last. The components are of good quality, including chain bars from industry leaders Oregon, and the range includes excellent features like 2 ring pistons, steel crankshafts, automatic aluminium oil pumps for optimum durability. </p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/204166066/Oleo-Mac_Chainsaw_MowHow_ImageScreen_Shot_2016-06-03_at_13.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"460\" height=\"233\"></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\">Oleo-Mac Chainsaw - with Oregon Bar</p>\r\n<p>2. <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><strong>Health and Safety</strong></span>. All Oleo-Mac chainsaws are fitted with the very best safety devices, like their chain brakes, chain-catchers and, in addition, their 'burn-right' technology ensures their saws are clean and emit low-emissions, better for the environment and safer and cleaner for the operator. </p>\r\n<p>3. <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><strong>Easy Maintenance.</strong></span> Maintaining a chainsaw is very important so the designers at Oleo-Mac go out of their way to make it as easy as possible, with such features as mufflers that you can easily check and inspect and oil and filter covers that can be removed without tools as well as transparent tanks so levels can be checked very easily. Plus side-knob controlled chain tensioning on many models as well as sefl-cleaning filters. All of which means less time maintaining and more time working. </p>\r\n<p>4. <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><strong>Comfort and Ease of Operation</strong>.</span> Ergonomic design, including low-vibration handles, makes for more comfortable operation as do features such as the innovative “Easy-On” starting system, featured on some models. Also electronically controlled digital coils which also contribute to lower effort starting. </p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/204167746/Oleo-Mac_Woman_w_Chainsaw_MowHow_Image.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"364\" height=\"277\"></p>\r\n<p>5. <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><strong>Value</strong>.</span> Make no mistake, the value for money offered by Oleo-Mac chainsaws is a major feature and one very much appreciated by customers. Value in this case means high-end quality at much lower prices and our exclusive deals, here at MowDirect make the most of our exclusive and valued relationship. </p>\r\n<p> </p>"},{"id":209123286,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/209123286.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/209123286-Hayter-70-Years-Of-Quality-Watch-The-Short-Film","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":0,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":202063746,"created_at":"2016-06-02T10:53:49Z","updated_at":"2016-06-03T11:50:57Z","name":"Hayter - 70 Years Of Quality - Watch The Short Film","title":"Hayter - 70 Years Of Quality - Watch The Short Film","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2016-06-03T11:50:57Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127732,"label_names":[],"body":"<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/204140626/Hayter-Logo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"383\" height=\"98\"></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">The story of Hayter in under two minutes.</span></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">From Hayter's beginnings in the 1940s to its present position at the pinnacle of the quality lawnmower market, this film shows just why these classic, iconic lawn mowers, and the exceptional finish they offer, are so well loved by their owners.</p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://youtu.be/OWyHfegVCc4\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/204347083/Hayrer_Film_Screen_Shot_2016-06-02_at_12.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"> </p>"},{"id":210525643,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/210525643.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/210525643-Oleo-Mac-an-Italian-success-story","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":0,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":202062163,"created_at":"2016-05-24T15:16:08Z","updated_at":"2021-02-21T17:08:17Z","name":"Oleo-Mac – an Italian success story","title":"Oleo-Mac – an Italian success story","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2018-01-23T12:55:03Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127732,"label_names":[],"body":"<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"> <img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/203982946/oleomac_logo_500x172.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"361\" height=\"125\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/oleo-mac\">Oleo-Mac</a> is not, necessarily, a name every gardening enthusiast would know.

This one specialised in creating popular and reliable brushcutters.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Eventually an executive decision targeting growth and the sharing of expertise, knowledge and skills led to the merging of the two companies and the creation of EMAK.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Bartoli and Ferretti built up a dynamic and comparative company creating garden machinery for both the domestic and commercial markets in Italy and, increasingly, in the rest of Europe.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">25 years ago EMAK became incorporated into parent company YUMA spa and is the flagship company of the group, having expanded their production and expertise into a wide variety of garden machinery.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">The founder members are still still very much involved as Bartoli is president of YUMA spa and Ferretti is president of EMAK.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Oleo-Mac machines are made with care and attention to detail, remarkably well featured and well made for the money, offering amazing value.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">They have expanded and grown almost exponentially, going from the merger in 1992, construction of new factory in 1995 for the brushcutters and chainsaws that made their name initially, creating a lawnmower plant in 1997, listed on the Milan stock exchange 1998 and the creation of commercial branches across Europe, manufacturing centres in China and commercial branches in USA and Poland across the years.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Their competitors are remarkably few, but the quality of them (they include Stihl and Husqvarna, two of the most respected names in powered garden machinery) shows the kind of level at which Oleo-Mac are operating. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">They lay out their vision as…</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">“Innovative solutions to offer the customer the best possible value. </span><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">We intend to be, in the development, production and distribution of machines, components and accessories for gardening, agriculture, forestry and industry, one of the leading players at worldwide level by offering innovative products and services, making the activity for our consumer and professional customers efficient and enjoyable, providing them with the best value.“</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">And they are doing it very well so far.

Einhell is now a leading manufacturer in Germany and major designer and maker of garden machinery and  power tools, still innovating, still investing and still trying make sure everything is 'Well Done' the Einhell philosophy and company motto.</p>\n<p>Einhell products are distinctive and individual in design - another part of the philosophy - and the company's forward thinking strategy means Einhell is a major investor in battery technology with a growing line of powerful, user-friendly Li-ion powered garden equipment. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/einhell/einhell-power-x-change\">The Future - Einhell's 'one battery fits all' Power Exchange Range </a></span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/einhell/einhell-power-x-change\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/204108163/index.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"340\" height=\"283\"></a> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"bodytext\">  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"bodytext\"> </p>\n<p class=\"bodytext\"> </p>"},{"id":210376523,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/210376523.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/210376523-Hayter-a-brief-history","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":0,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":202063746,"created_at":"2016-05-17T09:36:43Z","updated_at":"2016-06-01T15:23:29Z","name":"Hayter - a brief history","title":"Hayter - a brief history","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2016-06-01T15:18:01Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127732,"label_names":[],"body":"<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/204329123/Hayter-Logo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"390\" height=\"100\"></p>\r\n<p>Hayter lawnmowers are known for their familiar heritage British Racing Green livery and classic design and loved for their reliability and quality.

He was born in 1914 in Bishop’s Stortford on the border of Essex and Hertfordshire and grew up to become a aeronautical service engineer for an air circus then a builder’s apprentice finally building creating his own building and engineering business in Spellbrook, a hamlet between Harlow and Bishop’s Stortford.</p>\r\n<p>To this end he built his own workshops and sawmills to create a successful business, did some ‘top secret’ designing and engineering for the War Office, repaired farm machinery and manufactured cattle yard equipment.</p>\r\n<p>He built homes (luxury caravans) for his workers out of old RAF containers and seemed to be perpetually inventing and innovating, always looking for ideas and using all his experience to improve the standard of living for his family and employees.</p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/204269783/Douglas_Hayter.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"246\" height=\"295\"></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><strong>Douglas Hayter</strong></p>\r\n<p>After borrowing a cutter bar mower to clear space for a new building and finding it rather laborious, followed by a visit to the Science museum in London where he saw an old horse drawn rotary mower he became interested in creating a domestic mowing machine and made one for himself. </p>\r\n<p>When a neighbour saw this innovative machine in action he asked for one too, and this eventually led to the start of the Hayter business, becoming a limited company in 1946 and the first ‘Hayter Motor Scythe’, a hand-propelled. 24 inch cutting width motor mower, which started full production in 1947.</p>\r\n<p>Hayter continues to be a top selling brand, and a byword for quality, and continues to design and build many of its products in Spellbrook where it started. Here at MowDirect we are exceptionally proud of our long standing and successful relationship with this forward thinking and yet traditional, British company. </p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/lawnmowers/hayter-lawnmowers/hayter-harrier-lawnmowers\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">The Hayter Harrier - Consistent Top Seller</span></a></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/lawnmowers/hayter-lawnmowers/hayter-harrier-lawnmowers\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/204036203/ayter_harrier_41_push_front_elevation.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"248\" height=\"248\"></a></p>"},{"id":208693636,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/208693636.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/208693636-Mountfield-the-UK-s-number-1-for-half-a-century-","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":0,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":201994103,"created_at":"2016-05-09T14:01:49Z","updated_at":"2016-06-01T16:09:42Z","name":"Mountfield - the UK's number 1 for half a century ","title":"Mountfield - the UK's number 1 for half a century ","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2016-06-01T16:09:42Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127732,"label_names":[],"body":"<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"> <img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/204123426/mountfield_logo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"411\" height=\"98\"></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\">          <img class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/203739716/mf-princess-34-1000w_EDIT_SQ.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"119\" height=\"118\">             <img class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/203739746/Mountfield_2large_edit__1_.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"118\" height=\"118\">             <img class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/203954903/hp414_leftside_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"116\" height=\"116\">           </p>\r\n<p>It would be fair to say that <a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/mountfield\">Mountfield</a> is a very popular brand indeed in the UK, supplying lawnmowers, lawn and garden tractors and a wide range of hand held garden machinery and with a reputation for being reliable and of good quality. </p>\r\n<p>Mountfield is consistently cited as manufacturer of the UK's best selling garden and lawn tractors creating best in class models on a regular basis. These include the class leading 84cm cutting width, twin-bladed deck 1430M and 1430H garden tractors in 2012 and garden tractors featuring a twin-bladed deck for superior cutting and collecting performance. </p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/204330463/Multi_Mountfield_MowHow__2016-06-01_at_17.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"458\" height=\"140\"></p>\r\n<p>The story, however, began way back in 1962, when Mountfield rotary lawn mowers were first manufactured at their factory in Maidenhead.

A teardrop or semi-circle of uncut grass. This can of course be cut by returning or reversing and cutting again. A zero-Turn mower however, will eliminate this problem. <em>(See example below featuring walk-behind mowers)</em></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/202218635/FreewheelSteeringtsn_turning_radius_web.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"317\" height=\"183\"></p>\r\n<p>There is also the issue of trees, ornaments, borders and other obstacles. The smaller the turning circle you have, the more manoueverable your ride-on is.</p>\r\n<p>Subsequently the size of your turning circle will affect how long the lawn takes to mow and how much to-ing and fro-ing is involved.</p>\r\n<p>As a very rough guide, the turning circles of most ride-ons fall somewhere between 10 and 71cm  (4\" - 28\").</p>\r\n<p>Rear engine ride-ons have fairly good turning circles. Lawn Tractors circles are generally larger.</p>\r\n<p>Large ride-ons with out-front decks like the example below have good turning circles (246cm on this one) the body of the ride-on also follows the cutting deck precisley for easy manoeuverability.</p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-small\">A Stiga Villa With Out-Front Deck</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/202218685/Stiga-Villa-320-HST-_kgr_sklippare_8432.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"280\" height=\"242\"></p>\r\n<p>Zero-Turn mowers are ideal for pretty much eliminating the Turning Cirlce issue (<em>See example below</em>)</p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-small\">A Toro Zero-Turn Timecutter</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/202187159/TimeCutterSSco2015s_tcz74630_74631_ss5000_r_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"294\" height=\"254\"></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><br> If you would like to see our range of ride-ons and compare for yourself, please click <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue90\">here.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"> </p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"> </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p> </p>"},{"id":203914169,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/203914169.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/203914169-Product-Review-Writing-Guidelines","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":true,"draft":true,"promoted":false,"position":0,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":2,"section_id":200968725,"created_at":"2015-03-19T10:29:21Z","updated_at":"2018-03-05T12:02:59Z","name":"Product Review Writing Guidelines","title":"Product Review Writing Guidelines","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2018-03-05T12:02:59Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127732,"label_names":[],"body":"<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/201876359/Fotolia_72491022_XS.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"432\" height=\"292\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">We are actively seeking your input with regard to the equipment you have purchased and your experience as a customer.</p>\n<p>Customer product reviews are a vital tool for the online purchaser, offering a chance to get a feel for a product that they have not actually handled and giving important tips and advice on assembly, performance or features.</p>\n<p>Acting in concert with our product descriptions, specs and feature lists, your product reviews can pass on your experience to other potential customers.</p>\n<p>Please follow our guidelines as closely as possible, to offer useful and detailed information to your fellow customers.</p>\n<p><strong>GUIDELINES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Try to be objective and focus on your experience and details of the product</li>\n<li>Please make your review between 50 to 500 words approximately.</li>\n<li>We are not looking for flattery, but we do ask for honest, considered opinion and useful information - positive or negative.</li>\n<li>We will not publish any review that contains obscenity, advertising or is insulting or offensive to persons, groups or companies.</li>\n<li>Think about the title.

But, like anything else, you get out what you put in; so do invest some time and effort and you will be rewarded by efficient, smooth performance year in year out. </p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-small\"><em><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/202155579/87F4TracSeries.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"317\" height=\"264\"> </em></span></p>\r\n<p>Here are some guidelines, in the form of DOs and DONT's to help you make the most of your machine.  Take a few moments to read through these and we feel sure you will see how important and easy it is to keep your tractor or Ride-On in tip top condition</p>\r\n<p><strong>PETROL</strong>: Modern fuel deteriorates with age, and contains an alcohol called ethanol that absorbs moisture from the atmosphere and  causes the fuel to separate and go stale in as little as 30 days. This can damage your machine and create starting issues. <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">DO</span> add fuel stabilising additive to all fuel before filling garden machinery engines* and <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">DONT'</span> leave unstabilised fuel in your tank for long periods. </p>\r\n<p><strong>STORAGE:</strong> Lawnmower engines are not waterproof – <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">DON'T <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">leave</span> </span>your machine in a damp or wet place. Do keep it dry where possible </p>\r\n<p><strong>OIL SERVICING:</strong> <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">DO</span> refer to your ‘Engine’ manual regarding regular oil change schedules. These ensure your engine does not suffer irreparable internal wear and damage.</p>\r\n<p><strong>BATTERY:</strong> If your machine is supplied with a battery charger, <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">DO</span> please refer to the battery manual for guidance on how frequently you will need to charge. This is very important as it can help you get maximum life from your battery.</p>\r\n<p><strong>SLOPES:</strong> <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">DON'T </span>cut at steep angles. We generally advise a maximum of 15 degrees tilt when cutting on slopes and our top tip is to always cut across the slope, not up and down.</p>\r\n<p><strong>GRASS COLLECTOR:</strong> If your machine has a dedicated collector, <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">DO</span> check that this is shut down firmly, ensuring the safety switch is making contact when trying to engage the cutters. If you don’t your machine can easily cut out when engaging the blades. </p>\r\n<p><strong>UNEVEN GROUND:</strong> <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">DON't</span> cut at low height settings and high speeds. You should always cut at a higher height setting and at the slowest speed setting</p>\r\n<p><strong>BELTS:</strong> Deck and Drive Belts are known as ‘wearing parts’ so do <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">DO</span> try to ensure the machine is operated correctly when cutting to ensure they are not overloaded causing them to fail.</p>\r\n<p><strong>GRASS &amp; MUD:</strong> <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">DON'T</span> leave wet grass and mud on your mower. Regular cleaning of the underside of your machine is essential. Grass left there can cause metal components to rust. Grass and Dirt in or around the engine can clog the cooling fins resulting in overheating and damage.</p>\r\n<p><strong>SERVICING:</strong> Annual Servicing is a recommendation from the manufacturers and a requirement in order to extend the guarantee beyond the first year. <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">DO</span> remember to set this up with your dealer, as out of tune engines and blunt blades can cause inefficient operation resulting in poor cutting, poor collection, and environmental pollution.</p>\r\n<p>Follow these simple dos and don'ts and your machine should give your service for a good long time. </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><em>*If you need to purchase a supply of stabiliser, it can be purchased through our parts team ...</em><a href=\"mailto:parts@mowdirect.co.uk\">parts@mowdirect.co.uk</a></p>"},{"id":202374847,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/202374847.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/202374847-How-to-set-up-a-portable-generator-to-provide-back-up-power-","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":0,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200247857,"created_at":"2014-04-18T12:56:57Z","updated_at":"2015-04-20T14:37:30Z","name":"How to set up a portable generator to provide back up power?","title":"How to set up a portable generator to provide back up power?","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2015-04-20T14:37:30Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200705753/Fotolia_63312295_XS2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"153\" height=\"130\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200628136/Fotolia_63312295_XS.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"158\" height=\"131\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200705753/Fotolia_63312295_XS2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"144\" height=\"131\"></span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">You can use a portable generator for emergency backup in a couple of ways. Let’s imagine you have a power cut. Bother. Now what to do? We can offer  two scenarios. </span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">1. This scenario requires a standard portable generator and the size depends on what you are going to power with it. </span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">You have a your portable generator stored in the shed. You take your torch, go and fetch the generator, fill it with petrol, take it somewhere outside – a minimum of 10ft from the house. Then you run a heavy-duty cable into the house and plug whatever you need into a heavy-duty multi-gang. This will not, of course, power ceiling-lights, or electrical sockets. </span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>N.B.</strong> <em>You must never have the generator running inside your dwelling or a room you will be staying in, due to carbon monoxide petrol fumes. You could run the generator from an outhouse, but you will have to create some kind of exhaust venting and air intake for cooling, even open doors. </em></span><em><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">A generator should not be shut running inside a shed with the doors closed. Make sure you don’t use ordinary household cables, particularly outside. You’ll need to invest in good-quality, shielded, weatherproof cabling to take the power into your home.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">2. This scenario requires a larger more powerful portable generator. </span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">You go and get your portable generator and you plug into the mains to replace the mains power. The same rules apply regarding cabling and using the generator outside, using good-quality cabling etc, but there is little more to it than that because this solution requires some work by a qualified electrician. The generator MUST be isolated from the mains supply for safety and efficiency. Otherwise, power can back-feed along the lines and you could electrocute the poor chap down the line trying to fix the mains supply, or even give a nasty shock to your neighbours. So make sure a manual transfer switch is installed by a qualified electrician. This is fitted between the meter and the consumer unit, connecting the building, and you plug your lead from the generator into an inlet connector. </span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>N.B.</strong> <em>You will also have to have an RCD (Residual Current Device) fitted if you don’t have one already. This is a safety device built into consumer units in many buildings. Your generator will need modifying to utilise this. Again, a qualified electrician will need to do this. Finally, a low impedance earth spike will also need to be installed so, as a general note, DO NOT attempt this second solution without at least a long talk with a qualified electrician. It will be worth it, and is essential for safety.

But you know that. at some point, the weather will improve and you'll want to be out there again. </span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Here are a few ways to make it up to your patio and pamper your paved areas when the weather starts to improve and you want to sit outside with your friends and family, or just a cup of tea and a good book. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"> 1. Clear your patio of any furniture, toys, broken twigs, branches, pots and plants and give it a good sweep with a stiff brush. Try brushing the cracks to remove loose weeds. If you can't move your furniture, cover and wrap it so it is protected while you use the pressure washer (see note 3). </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">2. Carry out some more judicious and deep weeding. Perhaps use a dedicated weeding tool. many companies make these as part of a hand tool collection. If you have loose paving slabs, get a weeding tool to remove the weeds between slabs. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">3. If you have a pressure washer, this is the time to get it out and carry out a deep clean of your stones or slabs. Most pressure washers will have the appropriate tool, a 'fan' type spray for general cleaning and a 'high-pressure' nozzle for stubborn stains. Some even have special patio cleaners with enclosed brushes and nozzle to avoid splashback.

Now check for serious cracks and holes, some of which may have been highlighted by the pressure washer.  Tap away any loose concrete and create good areas for filler. Fill cracks or holes where necessary with fresh mortar.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">5. Clean your patio furniture. Again, if appropriate use the pressure washer on plastic and wood (again make sure you read the instructions) or scrub down wooden furniture and re-varnish or protect it. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">6. Now. put everything back, perhaps invest in some new pot plants and enjoy your outdoor space before the winter rolls around again. </span></p>\n<p> </p>"},{"id":202363458,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/202363458.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/202363458-The-right-hedge-plants-for-topiary-plus-a-brief-history","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":0,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200264616,"created_at":"2014-04-11T10:57:20Z","updated_at":"2017-09-21T12:18:01Z","name":"The right hedge plants for topiary plus a brief history","title":"The right hedge plants for topiary plus a brief history","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2017-09-21T12:18:01Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/202144649/Fotolia_70668210_XS.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"501\" height=\"335\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Topiary is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as<font size=\"2\"> '<em>concerned with involving or formed by, the clipping of shrubs, trees etc into ornamental  geometric.animal or other shapes</em>' and comes from the Latin 'toparius, pertaining to ornamental gardening, originally from the Greek for 'place'. </font></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">In Europe, as in the Middle East, it is an ancient art, going back thousands of years. It was used in Roman gardens, and mentioned in Roman writings (including writing by Pliny) with reference to the reign of Julius Caesar (100BC - 44BC) and has been featured in such widely varied creative platforms as the film Edward Scissorhands and Walt Disney's theme parks. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><font size=\"1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Topiary</span> </font>can range from simple trimming of a hedge into severe oblong and square shapes all the way up to fantastical and elaborate creatures such as unicorns, dragons and corkscrew spirals. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">The plants used need to respond well to extensive trimming. They  should be strong and have thick foliage with smaller leaves for better coverage when shaped. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Notable plants used, particularly in this country include <strong>Box, Yew, Bay</strong> and <strong>Privet, </strong>but there are examples of<strong> Hawthorn </strong>and<strong> Hollies </strong>being used and some plants are better for simple shapes whereas some are more suitable for elaborate animals and other objects. There are many varieties used in other, hotter countries.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Obviously the natural height of a shrub or plants will affect how you shape it and taller thinner shapes my be easier with some varieties than others. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Tip</strong>: A plant is likely to need a few years growth before you start seriously trimming and shaping so think about this when starting.

Don't </strong>use hot water to clear snow. It replaces the snow with black 'invisible' ice which is even more hazardous</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">3. <strong>Do</strong> think about where you deposit the snow you clear. However you do it, a shovelful or snow blower stream of broken snow and ice thrown to the side of your path is one thing. Flinging it into your next door neighbour's garden is a no-no.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">4. <strong>Don't </strong>clear all the patch at once. It is better to clear the centre of your path first then work outwards to the sides. That way you are always working on a cleared and safe surface.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">5. <strong>Do</strong> use salt if need be. But remember some plants are very sensitive to ordinary salts and it could destroy them.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">6. <strong>Don't</strong> use all the salt from the local salt bins to clear your yard or paths. Make</span> sure enough is left to clear roads, pavements and other communal areas. Sand and ash are fairly good substitutes for salt if you are finding it hard to source. They don't melt in the same way but can help to provide firmer footing.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">7. <strong>Do</strong> remember that if you are running a business you have a duty of care to try to make sure walkways and areas walked on by your customers, staff or the public are kept clear and safe where possible.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">8.

When you have harvested your wood, make sure you cut it into </span><font size=\"2\">logs that are the right length for your fire or stove and split into logs.  Smaller logs will dry faster so do make sure you cut to size before the seasoning process proper begins.</font></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">2. <strong>Store your logs in a dry area like a wood shed</strong>. Make sure wherever you choose is well ventilated. Either a wood shed, or alternatively store outside in a stack, so the sun and wind can dry the logs. Many people using the outdoor method will make  sure the wood is covered and cannot get soaked with rain or snow. This depends on when you store the wood and when you gather it to take it inside or transfer to a shed. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">3. <strong>Store the wood for at least a season.</strong> By season we mean from the time they are felled to the following Autumn, when you may start needing them. If you can store them for two or more seasons, so much the better but that takes a lot or pre-planning and is not always possible.

Every petrol lawn mower will have a an OPC. OPC <font size=\"2\">stands for Operator Presence Control and if you let it go the engine will stop. This is for safety so it cannot run amok without you controlling it. </font>This is the handle you pull towards yourself that squeezes against the main handle (s<em>ee fig A below</em>).</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><font size=\"2\">4. <strong>Mower Controls:</strong> (s<em>ee fig A below</em>) Familiarise your self with all the controls. A petrol lawn mower will have an OPC, a throttle for revs', maybe a drive lever or bail-arm if it has a self-propelled drive system. Nowadays the recoil pull is often attached at the handle. These are fairly standard but <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">do check your manual</span> for any alternative details. See below for a fairly typical petrol lawn mower control system.</font></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><em>Fig A. Standard Petrol lawn mower controls</em></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"> <img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200519648/Effco48tkdx_1_.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"525\" height=\"257\"></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">5. <strong>Mulch Plug</strong>: If your lawn mower comes with a mulch plug included, chances are it is already in the machine for safe transport purposes. it will be in the grass exit channel and, of course, you will not be able to cut and collect with it in. This is definitely worth checking as it often causes customers to think their machine is not working. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">6. <strong>Cutting Height Controls: </strong>Make sure you know where your cutting height adjustment controls are. On a very basic machine they l lever, or will be individual axle levers or a central lever or a front and rear control. Your manual will help and if you need to know more about this. Try our detailed article '<a href=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201804468-How-do-I-adjust-the-cutting-height-on-my-rotary-lawn-mower-\">How Do I Adjust the Cutting Height on my Rotary Lawn Mower?'</a></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">7. <strong>Oil and Fuel A:</strong> Petrol lawn mowers are NOT transported ready fuelled. Even when bought as 'ready to go', they are NOT filled with oil or fuel for safety purposes during transport. You will always need to oil band fuel them before your first use.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">8<strong>. Oil and Fuel B:</strong> Check your machine and/or manual to see if your machine has an oil/fuel on/off tap. Make sure not is on before you start the mower.  </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">9. <strong>Choke: </strong>Check your machine and/or manual to see if it has a choke. If so, please make sure it is fully on before you start the mower. (But remember, once it is warm, you must disengage it).</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">10. <strong>Grass Collector:</strong> If you have a machine with a grass box/bag/collector, check it is is fitted properly and is flush before you start. The manual, again, will help with this. If it is not fitted properly,it could fall off and a deflector will snap down to cover the channel. </span></p>"},{"id":202117918,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/202117918.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/202117918-Why-Should-I-Never-Leave-Petrol-In-The-Tank-","author_id":290886932,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":0,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200366463,"created_at":"2014-03-05T15:12:45Z","updated_at":"2015-04-21T13:46:55Z","name":"Why Should I Never Leave Petrol In The Tank?

It should always be stored in a suitable container like a<span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\"> J<span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">erry Can.</span></span> <br></span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">We never recommend using petrol that has been left unused for more than 30 days. </span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><font size=\"2\">This is a common cause of calls to our consultants, people will often leave petrol in their machines (lawn mowers particularly) over the whole of the winter and then expect them to work fine. </font></span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><font size=\"2\">What actually happens is that fuel can go through a number of processes, from evaporation, where the most combustable elements may evaporate and affect the efficiency of your engine to oxidisation.  </font></span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">You may well have had your old petrol mower for some time.OK. Motor fuels have changed significantly, over the last few years.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Modern motor fuel contains ethanol which deteriorates with age and contains alcohol which absorbs moisture from the atmosphere, causing the fuel to separate and go stale in as little as <em>30 days. </em></span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">This can cause damage and starting issues.

Now. Do we really want to be in the garden in January? Is there anything to do? Isn’t it better to sit it out in front of the fire? Well no. Yes it’s cold, yes it may be snowy, freezing, dark and gloomy, and your poor hands may be as blue as a berry but there is so much to be done in the garden or on your plot in the not-so-merry month of January, you’ll barely notice the cold once you get started, and it’s a great way to burn off a few winter comfort-food calories.</p>\n<p><strong>Delicate plants need protection from frost or heavy snow and slee</strong>t. When the temperature drops, gather up plants like fuchsias or rosemary and take them into the greenhouse or conservatory. Don’t forget to clean and tend them first.</p>\n<p><strong>Remember to remove any dead or rotten foliage or wood first,</strong> if branches are tough use a <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue110\">long reach tree pruner</span> (sees image below) to save effort, and make sure you have dealt with any pests before bringing them inside. There is still some warmth deep in the soil at this time of year, so January is actually a good season for <strong>planting new shrubs</strong>. If so, you will need a<span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue110\"> good quality planting spade</span> to cut into the ground and create a bed for the roots, a general all round spade to empty and fill in afterwards and <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue110\">a solid, hardwearing rake</span>, for covering the roots and shaping the area around the shrub.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360000274691/Redback_Pole_Pruner.jpg\" alt=\"Redback_Pole_Pruner.jpg\" width=\"256\" height=\"315\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><em>Redback E608DQ-2Ah Cordless Pole-Pruner</em></p>\n<p>This is also an appropriate time to carry out a <strong>general tidy of the garden</strong>, removing any dead foliage, branches and so on, anywhere, in fact, that pests like slugs or snails can hide. Clear your borders and vegetable patches of debris and detritus, to reduce the risk of disease and stop pests from spreading. Use a <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue110\">good rake</span>. A handy tip is to remember that a good ash wood handle   on your garden tools is corrosion proof and stays warmer to the touch than aluminium or plastic.</p>\n<p><strong>Vegetable beds may well need preparing for the coming yea</strong>r.

They are especially good at collecting wet grass due to the wide grass discharge channel and the is  short distance from the deck to the collector , compared with the longer distance in a side discharge machine.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Rear discharge decks are not quite as proficient with longer grass cutting as side discharge machines, so you may need to cut more often.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">The grass collection from a rear cutting deck is excellent. There is a short distance from deck to grass collector and the swift movement of the blades creates a strong draft that helps to carry the grass into the collector. (<em>See image below</em>)</span>  </p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200654798/reardischargeMTD.jpg\" alt=\"\">                          </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">You don’t need to be quite as careful about where your clippings go with a rear discharge machine; you can cut alongside your car or flowers with confidence as anything picked up ends up in the grass box.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Collectors will generally come as standard with a rear discharge mower. This kind of deck is found on many different types of ride-on including rear engine riders, rear collect tractors and heavy-duty garden tractors.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Side Discharge:</strong> This style of deck is ideal for longer grass in wilder areas such as overgrown gardens, orchards or meadows. It discharges to one side of the ride-on (<em>see image below</em>) and handles damp or wet grass very well.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200490837/Fotolia_54067722_XS.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Unlike walk-behind mowers, the side discharge deck is a stand-alone function, there are no combination decks with side and rear discharge so a side discharge ride-on does just that. (Though there are many ride-ons offering side discharge and mulching).</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">If your mower has reverse gears, you can back up to cut sections you may have missed with your turning circle.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">If you buy a side-discharge ride-on mower you will not usually be provided with a grass collector, but they will often be available as an optional extra. Collection is possible but these types of deck are at their best when mulching, discharging without collection and on less formal lawns and grassy areas.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Mulching Deck:</strong> A mulching deck is a deck specifically designed to use specially shaped blades to cut and re-cut the grass clippings until they are miniscule. Built in deflectors are sometimes situated in the deck to push the clippings back into the cutting area. (see image below) </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">                 <img class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\" style=\"text-align: center;\" src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200488863/TimeCutter-50in-Recycler-Kit-79019toro_z_50in_recycle_kit.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"403\" height=\"296\"></span><span style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">     </span>                    </span><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">The cuttings or clippings are then deposited directly into the lawn to make natural compost. These chopped-up clippings then breakdown and encourage nutrients, keeping moisture in the soil and preventing natural damage to the lawn.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">A green option, a mulching deck gives you the opportunity to recycle your clippings as compost to help create a greener, healthier lawn.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">If you mulch it means you don’t have to cut quite so often. In fact, you would cut probably around half as often and you don't have to keep emptying a collection bag or box full of clippings. As well as dedicated mulching decks there are options for mulching included on various types of ride-on mower and tractor including side discharge, rear discharge, heavy duty and zero turn ride-ons.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Out Front Deck:</strong> These are found almost exclusively on the front cut ride-on mowers</span>, <span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">as the name suggests.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Out-front decks have a number of advantages including visibility as, with the cutting-deck placed low in front of you, you can clearly see the area you are cutting and increase accuracy and efficiency.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">These decks can also give the ride-on increased manoeuvrability and in addition allows you to cut right up to the edge as you move forward and you can cut under overhanging branches, bushes, even benches. (see image below)</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-right\"><img style=\"text-align: center;\" src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200490007/Husqvarnafrontcut.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"414\" height=\"243\"><span style=\"text-align: center;\">                  </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Powered Sweeper:</strong> This is a very specific type of ‘cut-drop-and-collect’ deck found on very few machines (almost exclusively on Westwood Tractors). In this deck the grass is cut with a mid-machine deck and the clippings are dropped straight down. There is a brush fitted behind the deck attached to a collector. The brush revolves clockwise and on the horizontal, lifting the clippings and other detritus from the lawn and sweeping them up back and into the collector. (See image below). These decks are also capable of cutting and dropping and mulching when the brush and collector fitting is removed. </span></p>\r\n<p><img class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200398796/WESTWOODBRUSH.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>"},{"id":201651783,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/201651783.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201651783-A-pictorial-guide-to-the-main-features-of-a-hedgetrimmer","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":0,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200262716,"created_at":"2014-01-27T14:34:45Z","updated_at":"2015-04-16T11:28:41Z","name":"A pictorial guide to the main features of a hedgetrimmer","title":"A pictorial guide to the main features of a hedgetrimmer","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2015-04-16T11:28:41Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Although manufacturers have their own features and design and function can change, most hedge trimmers have a great many common features and the shape is relatively generic.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Here is a guide to the main features you will find on most double-sided models.</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200456467/ECHOHedgetrimmerMAIN.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"594\" height=\"298\"></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">There are various adaptations of these basic features.

It can be caused by catching the tip of the saw in the wood you are cutting or catching the saw in the cut. It can be reduced by a number of good practises while sawing. It is the main reason for wearing specialised clothing and potential injury can be virtually eradicated by using the right protective gear.*</p>\r\n<p><strong>Limbing</strong> – The action or task of cutting lateral, or side branches from a felled or standing tree as a preparation for creating logs or transporting the trunk.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Nose Sprocket</strong> – Sometimes know as the <strong>Sprocket Tip.</strong> A wheel like device at the end of the <strong>Guide Bar</strong> (see above) which eases the chain around the curve of the bar and can help prevent kickback.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>* <em>See the articles in our</em> <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue110\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Chainsaw Safety</span></span><em> section for more information </em></p>"},{"id":201260136,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/201260136.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201260136-A-glossary-of-pressure-washer-terms-phrases-and-acronyms-","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":0,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200310953,"created_at":"2014-01-17T11:52:57Z","updated_at":"2015-04-17T10:36:40Z","name":"A glossary of pressure washer terms, phrases and acronyms ","title":"A glossary of pressure washer terms, phrases and acronyms ","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2015-04-17T10:36:40Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<p><strong>Adjustable Wand/Lance</strong> – Most pressure washers are supplied with accessories and most will have some version of an adjustable wand or lance.

As the oft quoted poet Joyce Kilmer once mused “<em>I think that I will never see, a poem lovely as a tree</em>”.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"> <img class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/202144219/Fotolia_80342110_XS.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Trees provide shade for us and for other plants and animals. They offer beauty,</span><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> fruit, act as natural wind breaks, as climbing frames for our kids and offer many other functions and pleasures. But if you are thinking of planting a new tree, there are some things it is well worth knowing. Take a look at this simple guide to planting and maintaining a healthy young tree.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">1. What are you planting for? Shade? Appearance? Abundant fruit? Wood for your stove or fire? Think about what kind of tree you want. Look at your soil and the aspect of your garden, look at the kind of trees that are thriving in your area and choose accordingly. </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">2. Young trees should generally be planted in winter when they are dormant.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">3. Think very carefully about where you plant your tree. Put it in a good place for both you and the tree. Remember the roots of trees generally stretch a long way. Place your tree too close to the kitchen wall without thinking it through and a joy now could become a destructive menace in ten years time.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">4. Do use a stake to assist your tree in the first period of growing. Stakes will act like splints to help steady a tree and help it grow. Check your stakes to make sure they are secure to avoid root damage from too much swaying or movement from strong winds when the tree is young.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">5. The ties you use to attach the tree to the stake need to be checked regularly to make sure they are secure (for the same reason as the stakes) but also make sure they are loosened as the tree grows to allow it to develop naturally.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">6. It is worth putting some kind of circular collar type protection around the bottom of the tree when it is developing. Use a plastic tin, whatever, something that can completely surround the bottom of the tree. These stop dogs, foxes and other pests from vandalising the base of the tree.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">7. Water newly planted trees in spring and summer (April through May). It is almost impossible to over water a young tree and, perhaps surprisingly to some people, they are going to need watering for three to five years</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">8. <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Avoid evaporation by watering early or late in the day not the middle of the day.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\" style=\"font-size: small;\">9. A six foot 'standard' tree needs at least 30 litres per week.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">10. Mulch around the bottom of your tree with loose wood chippings or leaf mould. This helps to prevent weeds which can steal precious nutrients and water. It also helps retain water so the tree gets more of the available liquid. </span><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Mulch should have max depth of 10-15 cm. Any more and the generated heat could damage the roots</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Factfile: </strong>For more information on <em>tree care, why not check out the <a href=\"http://www.forestry.gov.uk/\">Forestry Commission</a> - looking after trees for almost </em><em>a century, or, alternatively try the <a href=\"http://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/?gclid=CLXcwde4nMkCFQvhGwode9wHZw&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">Woodland Trust</a>.

What to do next? Well before you fire it up, be sure to read these common causes for engine starting problems - and get yourself off to a roaring start!</span><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"> </span></strong></div>\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><em>           </em>                         </span></div>\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"> </div>\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">\n<span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">1. <strong>The Manual:</strong> Oh no you say, not the manual! Who wants to read pages and pages of guff in twenty different languages before getting on with the important business of mowing the lawn. Boring, boring, boring! Well, hold on a second. Whilst it may not be the most exhilarating half an hour of your life, following the manufacturer's advice can save you a lot of bother especially when it comes to starting up your new mower. Bear in mind also that you have bought a mechanical device with some very sharp cutting equipment attached and it's important </span><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">that you operate it correctly and safely. So, even if you have had tons of experience of using petrol mowers before, please do take the time to read the manufacturer's instructions prior to attempting to start the engine as there may be features and functions you are unfamiliar with.</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"> </div>\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">2. <strong>Oil:</strong> It's really, really important that before you even think about pulling that recoil rope you ensure the oil chamber is filled with the correct quantity and type of lubricant. (If you have bought a new mower from <a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/\">MowDirect</a>, a bottle of SAE30 lawnmower oil will be included in the box with our compliments.) If you try starting the mower with insufficient oil the engine will seize up and won't start again. If you put too much in it will also inhibit starting and you will have to drain the excess oil back out. Therefore <em>always check the manual</em> for the correct amount. (It will be somewhere between 400-600ml depending on make and model.)</span></div>\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"> </div>\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">3. <strong>Fuel:</strong> ‘Doh!’ - a schoolboy error but not an uncommon one. Check the fuel tank to make sure you are fuelled up and ready to mow. It's a good idea to only put in what you need as left over fuel can go stale very quickly causing starting issues next time you use the mower.</span></div>\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"> </span></div>\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">4. <strong>Fuel Tap:</strong> Most modern engines don't have fuel taps but if there is one fitted make sure it is in the 'ON' position.</span></div>\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"> </span></div>\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">5. <strong>The Choke:</strong> If you have a choke on your mower, make sure it is fully on when starting from cold. (You'll need to switch it off once the engine has warmed up a bit otherwise the engine might become 'flooded' with fuel and cut out. If that happens you will need to leave it for a few minutes before re-starting.)</span></div>\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"> </div>\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">6. <strong>The Primer:</strong> Primers are an alternative to chokes and now more common on mower engines. If your mower has a primer (usually a black or red plastic bulb located on the side of the engine) you will need to press it a few times when starting from cold. Don't squeeze it too many times as this can flood the engine with fuel.</span></div>\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"> </div>\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">7. <strong>OPC</strong>: Your petrol lawnmower will have a safety feature called the Operator Presence Control (OPC) lever and you will need to engage this in order to start the engine. The OPC lever is a bail arm that can be found in front of the top part of the mower handle and pulls towards you. Before trying to start your machine make sure you engage this lever. (You'll know if you haven't as the recoil will feel very stiff and won't pull over.) To stop the engine you simply release the OPC lever.</span></div>\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"> </div>\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">8. <strong>Oil in Air Filter:</strong> If after filling with oil you have for any reason tipped your mower on its side (air-filter side of the engine facing down) it is possible that some of the oil may have found its way through to the filter where it can restrict the air flow required for combustion to occur. This will prevent your engine from starting and usually requires a replacement filter to remedy. When cleaning or checking the underside of your mower, it's important that you either tip the mower backwards or filter-side up. (You might also consider draining the oil first using <a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/lawnmower-oil-extractor-kit-by-al-ko-106118.html\">one of these</a>.)</span></div>\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"> </div>\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Finally:</strong> If you are new to petrol lawnmowers and still having difficulties, don't panic. Some people find it can take a bit of getting use to at the beginning and you'll soon get the knack. If you are worried about whether you are giving it sufficient 'welly' then keep in mind that when set up correctly modern petrol lawnmower engines are relatively easy to start and if you have followed our advice it should pull over reasonably easy on first or second try. Have a short break and go back to it if you find your patience being tested as you may have missed something - perhaps check that manual again or ask a friend or neighbour with experience of these machines for a hand. If using a recoil start mower just isn't for you then you may want to consider an <a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/lawn-mowers/petrol-lawnmowers/petrol-four-wheel-rotary-lawn-mowers/self-propelled-4-wheel-petrol-lawn-mowers/all-deals-4052/lm-filter-prm-features/electric-start\">electric start model</a> or a <a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/lawn-mowers/cordless-battery-powered-lawn-mowers\">cordless mower</a>.</span></div>\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"> </div>\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">You can also find further advice on starting issues <a href=\"https://mowhow.mowdirect.co.uk/hc/en-gb/categories/200096713-Getting-Going\">here</a>.</span></div>\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"> </div>\n<div><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong> </strong></span></div>\n<div><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"> </span></div>\n<div><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"> </span></div>"},{"id":201063198,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/201063198.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201063198-Why-would-I-need-a-garden-vacuum-blower-or-sweeper-","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":1,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200244158,"created_at":"2013-12-16T11:28:57Z","updated_at":"2016-10-20T10:51:59Z","name":"Why would I need a garden vacuum, blower or sweeper?","title":"Why would I need a garden vacuum, blower or sweeper?","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2016-10-20T10:51:59Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<div><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">If you have trees in, or near, your garden or property that will shed leaves onto your lawn, or if you hold regular events where there is a build up of rubbish;

Every year we recycle soil, water, old leaves as compost and who has ever seen an allotment without huge collections of unwanted items from the home, now given a useful purpose, old string, cutlery, an old bucket here, a biscuit-tin there, old tennis balls used to lift nets to protect plants.  </p>\n<p>In fact, seriously thrifty gardening is very achievable if you just look around your home and liberate unwanted or used items. So here are a few recycling ideas for the garden or allotment,  re-using rubbish or unwanted debris and detritus from your home.  </p>\n<p>1.Why spend money down at your garden centre when old ice-cream tubs and biscuit tubs can be used as plant pots?</p>\n<p>2. Old takeaway boxes can be used, not just for storage of seeds and bits and bobs but as seed trays. Pierce some holes in the bottom and they are ideal for starting off small crops. </p>\n<p>3. Washing up liquid, squash or fizzy pop bottles (well washed) can be used as small cloches, covers for plants that need protecting. Cut the bottoms off and place over the plants. If they need ventilation, take the tops off. </p>\n<p>4. Old egg cartons transform very easily into chitting trays for potatoes. </p>\n<p>5. Silver paper, old CDS, in fact, anything shiny or reflective that makes noise when moved can be used as scarers to keep birds from eating your seeds or crops. Strips of silver paper hanging from poles have been particularly effective for some gardeners.  </p>\n<p>6. Old carpet or rigs can be used as a protective covering for turned over soil beds, keeping them weed free and warm.</p>\n<p>7. Food waste from your kitchen can be used to create compost.

Scatter an unbroken defensive wall around the plants.</p>\n<p>Eggshells can also be used as feed for plants as they contain high levels of calcium. Break them up and leave in water for a few days then water your plants as normal.</p>\n<p>8. Water, in general, can be recycled. Water from a changed fishtank is especially rich in nutrients and can, therefore, be used as a watering feed. Water from cooking vegetables, water from bottles that are unfinished, even water normally wasted while running it to get it warm, all of these could be used in the garden or plot. Boiling old water can be used to kill weeds.</p>\n<p><em>Food can also be re-used as fertiliser, as Organic Authority points out. Acid-loving plants will benefit from recycled tea bags and coffee grounds, while recycled eggshells can be used to feed botanicals that like calcium-rich, alkaline conditions. Potassium-rich banana skins can be buried around the roots of rose bushes to give them a helping hand. Recycled coffee grounds also make a good pest deterrent, preventing your plants from being attacked by unwanted guests.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Old compost bags have a variety of uses, so don't throw them away!

Congratulations.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">We want you to get the most out of your scarifier, and enjoy using it efficiently and safely from the start. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">That's why we have created this guide, full of basic tips and advice, and including answers to the sorts of questions new scarifier owners frequently ask, to save you time and give you confidence.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">This way you can get all you want from your new purchase. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Assembly:</strong> Your new scarifier will arrive ‘boxed' and there is a minimal element of assembly. This is usually limited to attaching the 'Handlebars' and 'Grass catcher' and you will have to put fuel and oil in. Then you should be ready to start work. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><span style=\"font-weight: bolder;\"><strong>Manual</strong>: </span>We understand that manuals can be difficult to read from time to time and translations are not always as helpful as they might be. However, do try to read manual/instructions as thoroughly as you can and keep them to hand, at least during early use.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Fuel:</strong> Your new scarifier almost certainly has a 4-Stroke engine, so Oil and Petrol are put in separate compartments, no mixing required.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Petrol:<em> </em></strong>Modern fuel contains ethanol, which absorbs moisture and causes the fuel to deteriorate in as little as 30 days, causing damage and starting issues if left in the tank. Our suggested solution is either drain the tank if are going to leave it for a while or always add fuel stabilising additive to all fuel before filling up your tank. For the same reasons you should only put 'Fresh Unleaded Petrol' in your tank. Old fuel will degrade quickly if it has not already done so.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Oil: </strong>It is important not to under-fill or over-fill your machine. Please refer to your manufacturer's guidelines as to the quantity.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Regular oil changes protect your engine from damage and excessive wear. Do refer to your ‘Engine’ manual regarding schedules for regular oil changes.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Not all models come with oil in the box and none with oil in the tank. It is advisable to check and have some ready just in case. The type should be 10/30 Lawnmower Grade Oil, otherwise known as SAE 30.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Oil needs to be changed after the first 5 hours of use. Running in of the machine can cause minute particles of metal debris in the engine, which an oil change and flush removes safely.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Starting</strong><em>: </em>If you are having difficulty starting your machine, it is always advisable to check the following:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Ensure you are holding in the 'OPC Bar' (Operator Presence Control). If you are not holding this in you will be unable to pull out the recoil.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">If you have a 'Fuel Switch', please ensure this is on.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">If there is a 'Primer', check you have primed the machine.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">If there is a 'Throttle', check that this is fully on to start the machine and then reduce the throttle once the machine has started.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Throttle:</strong> Again, if there is a throttle on your model, do remember that it does not affect the speed of the machine, it simply reduces or increases the 'Revs' of the engine.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Storage</strong><em>: </em>Scarifier engines are not waterproof. So make sure you store yours in a dry place, covered if possible.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Cleaning: </strong>Obviously, by its very nature, a scarifier is going to be pulling up a great quantity of grass and mud to rid your lawn of thatch and moss. Subsequently, there will always be wet and organic debris in and amongst the tines when you bring it into the shed, or wherever you store it. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Wet and rotting grass and mud can causes metal components to rust and grass and dirt in or around the engine can cause overheating and damage. Always make sure you clean the tines and the deck regularly and thoroughly.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">You may need to tip the machine to clear the deck from beneath. Always tip from front to back so that the machine pivots/rests on the back wheels.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">NB: Never tip from side to side as this causes the oil to flood the air filter. This can contaminate your spark plug and carburettor. In fact, as a matter, of course, be aware of where the oil and fuel tanks are situated and if possible, empty before cleaning. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Scarifying: </strong>You may not have used a scarifier before. Here are a few things to consider:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Your first 'pass' over the lawn may look like a disaster. Do not worry. If you have followed the instructions you will have done the right thing even if your lawn looks a sight. It will heal and improve over time. As a customer put it...<em>'The result obviously looks fairly devastating while we wait for the grass to start growing but many barrow-loads of moss and thatch were effectively removed so I am very pleased with the machine.'</em></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">There will be a great deal of detritus pulled from your lawn, particularly the first couple of times you use your scarifier.  The experience of many of our customers is that the grass catcher is never big enough. Do not worry about this, it is a common issue. The fact is it can be almost impossible to create a grass catcher big enough for the amount of material a good scarifier will remove. After you have scarified a few times and the organic material your remove reduces in volume, you will probably find the grass bag or catcher is adequate. </span></li>\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">The best time to scarify a lawn: This does, of course, depend on your lawn and many other factors, however, in general, late spring - somewhere around the middle of April to June and late summer early autumn - somewhere around late August to September are good times to do some light scarifying, not too deep. Then deeper, more aggressive, scarifying can be carried out in the Autumn, perhaps late August early September, maybe even early October depending on weather conditions. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">This MowHow article offers more detailed <a href=\"https://mowhow.mowdirect.co.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/115003138426-Do-I-Need-a-Scarifier-\">information on scarifying.</a></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Servicing:</strong> Don’t forget that Annual Servicing is recommended by the manufacturers and is a requirement if you want to extend the guarantee beyond the first year. Out of tune engines and blunt blades can result in poor cutting, poor collection, and environmental pollution.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">And finally, we’d like to thank you for your custom.

Here are some tips that will hopefully help you to carry out this task safely and accurately. </p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Take a good look at what is around the tree. Try to work out the approximate height and look for a clearance area at least the same distance in metres as the height of the tree. If there are objects around or near the tree (greenhouse, fence, statue, garden furniture, washing line etc) they will have to be moved, at least temporarily, if you want to take the tree down safely. In woodland you will have to think about other trees around it. </p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> Decide exactly where the tree will land after cutting and make doubly sure the area is cleared to a good distance. A radius that clears the tree by several metres more than its height is preferable.</p>\n<p><strong>3</strong>. Decide on an escape path at a 45° angle to the back of the tree (i.e the opposite side to the way it is due to fall). Clear anything from around the tree and make sure pets, children and anyone else) cannot get near.  </p>\n<p><strong>4. </strong>Make sure your chainsaw is fully fuelled (or charged) sharpened and that all the safety features are fully operational.</p>\n<p><strong>5</strong>. Wear appropriate clothing. You should wear a proper safety helmet when using a chainsaw under all circumstances but particularly when cutting down a tree. You also need ear-defenders, a visor, good quality heavy-duty gloves, heavy, preferably steel-toed, shoes or boots and tough and heavy-duty clothing, chainsaw proof if you have it.</p>\n<p><strong>6.</strong> The first cut is a 'Horizontal cut'. It should be around hip height and will determine the depth of your 'Wedge' or 'Notch' cut. It should never be more than a third of the tree's width. If you have a pro chainsaw it may well have sights (known as 'gunner's sights) that help with this - check your manual.  </p>\n<p><strong>7.</strong> The Wedge or Notch cut is the next step. this cut should be up to the back of the horizontal cut at 45°, leaving a wedge shaped hole. Make sure the cuts meet. (see image below)</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115004600051/Fotolia_153034217_XS.jpg\" alt=\"Fotolia_153034217_XS.jpg\"></p>\n<p><strong>8.</strong> The Back cut (felling cut) this cut is made at the rear of the tree, opposite to your other cuts. make it slightly higher than the previous cut (see image above). You need to make enough room to slip a wedge in. Drive in the wedge then keep cutting <em>without</em> touching the wedge. DON'T cut right through. When the tree starts to fall, move carefully down your planned escape route. </p>\n<p>Then, when everything is settled, you can start to limb the tree (take off the branches) and then buck it (cut up the trunk into logs). This is an effective way of making the tree easy to move and a practical way to create firewood for a wood burning stove or fireplace.  </p>\n<p>Here are some general <a href=\"https://mowhow.mowdirect.co.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/201057126-The-dos-and-don-ts-of-chainsaw-use\">dos and don'ts on Chainsaw safety </a>and a list of accredited <a href=\"https://mowhow.mowdirect.co.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/201057116-Chainsaw-safety-clothing-and-equipment\">chainsaw safety equipment</a> you should think about before undertaking a task like this. </p>\n<p>We also have a large range of <a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/chainsaws\">tree felling chainsaws available to buy</a>. </p>\n<p>If you decide this task is too much, here is a link to a <a href=\"https://www.trees.org.uk/ARB-Approved-Contractor-Directory\">useful directory of approved tree surgeons</a></p>\n<p>Good luck. </p>\n<p> </p>"},{"id":209077886,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/209077886.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/209077886-Oleo-Mac-lawnmowers-winning-fans-everywhere","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":2,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":202062163,"created_at":"2016-05-31T15:06:56Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T14:37:22Z","name":"Oleo-Mac lawnmowers - winning fans everywhere","title":"Oleo-Mac lawnmowers - winning fans everywhere","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2016-06-03T12:17:08Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127732,"label_names":[],"body":"<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/204384943/oleomac_logo_MowHow_58.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"367\" height=\"127\"></p>\r\n<p>Oleo-Mac petrol lawn mowers, from being relatively unfamiliar to UK customers have become, since MowDirect began to supply them, amongst our most popular machines, gaining fans and friends amongst satisfied lawn enthusiasts everywhere and garnering glowing comments and praise.</p>\r\n<p>This is largely down to a combination of quality, reliability, robust build styling and power at prices that are genuinely surprising to customers.

It is full of useful information and can save you 'phone calls and stress. <em><br></em></span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">2. <strong>Oil and Fuel:<em> </em></strong>A  petrol brushcutter needs filling with oil and fuel and, as it is more than likely to be a two-stroke machine, you'll have to mix the oil and the petrol with care to the right ratio. This link will give you the information you need on the oil and fuel and 2-stoke engines in general <a href=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/200995987-Basics-of-the-2-stroke-engine\">Basics of the 2-Stroke Engine</a></span></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">3. </font><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Correct Stance &amp; Handling: </strong>Before you switch the brushcutter on, make sure you practise actually handling the brushcutter, using the handles whether they be bike style or handle and loop style. This will help avoid potential strain or injury. Give your self plenty of room and make sure you have checked your standing position so the weight is distributed evenly. You manual should give you information on this.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-small\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">4. </span><strong style=\"font-size: small;\">Controls: </strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Make sure you know and understand all the controls of your brushcutter.<em> </em>Brushcutters vary widely in design and layout so check your manual very carefully for these details.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">5.</span><strong style=\"font-size: small;\"> Safety Clothing &amp; Equipment: </strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">We</span> <span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">always recommend that you wear safety goggles, at the very least, to avoid contact with flying twigs and leaves. In addition, solid, preferably steel-capped, boots would be good. Clothing should not be loose and a helmet could be useful. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">6.</span><strong style=\"font-size: small;\"> Safety Precautions: </strong><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> Make sure you are wearing no loose jewellery and that your hair, if long, is securely tied up before your first use. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-small\" style=\"font-size: small;\">Brushcutting in Sensible Clothing</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/202192865/Fotolia_66020596_XS.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"226\" height=\"349\"></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><em><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium wysiwyg-color-black\">7. </span></em><strong style=\"font-size: small;\">Screws, </strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium wysiwyg-color-black\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>N</strong></span></span><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>uts &amp; Bolts: </strong>Since your machine is new, these are probably going to be secure and tight but it is always worth checking and you should get used to doing this before every use.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">8. <strong>Line Feed: </strong>Your line may feed out automatically as it wears or it may be a 'tap-n-go' 'bump-n'go' type where you tap the head to fee out more line.

Consult your manual if in doubt. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">9. <strong>Harness: </strong>Your brushcutter may have come with a safety harness. If so, do make sure you know how to fit and use it before you start using your machine. Using it correctly will ease stain and offer you support, letting you work for longer but incorrect use could be potentially painful and harmful.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">10. <strong>Starting: </strong>It is always worth checking and becoming familiar with your starting process (be it a recoil or an electric start) before you get out into the field and begin lopping down grass blades.

And if you have any time or energy left after all that, and if it’s flowers and plants you are into, then sweet peas, pot marigolds, delphiniums, foxgloves…to be honest, there isn’t enough room for the whole list, so suffice to say, get your seed packets out and go for it.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">A little more ‘light scarifying’ of your lawn wouldn’t do any harm either.

A cheaper engine may seem fine but think about how long it will last compared to the next one up.</p>\r\n<p>2. <strong>How big is your lawn or garden?</strong> You will need an engine big enough and powerful enough to cope with the terrain and expanse of your lawn. </p>\r\n<p>3. <strong>Fuel cost.</strong> Don't buy a thirsty diesel tractor if your garden needs an economic ride-on mower. Or vice versa! </p>\r\n<p>4. <strong>How long do you want it to last?</strong> Bigger, more powerful engines with more cylinders tend to cause fewer vibrations and will therefore probably last longer. They may cost more now but offer more working hours in the long run.</p>\r\n<p>5. <strong>Even the best engine will not last if you don't look after it</strong>. Think about maintenance, compare how easy basic maintenance task are and like after, filling up checking oil, or cleaning your engine before you buy it.  </p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200494733/B_S_maintenance.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"421\" height=\"255\"> </p>\r\n<p>*You can compare ride-on mowers and tractors by engine size <strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\"><a href=\"http://v14prod.mowdirect.co.uk/lawn-garden-tractors/garden-tractors/rom-filter-type/rear-collect\" target=\"_blank\">if you click here.</a> </span></strong></p>"},{"id":201186543,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/201186543.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201186543-How-do-I-publish-my-content-in-other-languages-","author_id":290886932,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":2,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200265813,"created_at":"2013-11-27T15:50:23Z","updated_at":"2014-04-23T15:20:57Z","name":"How do I publish my content in other languages?","title":"How do I publish my content in other languages?","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2013-11-27T15:50:23Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<p>Here's the workflow for localizing your Help Center in other languages:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Get your content translated in the other languages.</li>\n<li>Configure the Help Center to support all your languages.</li>\n<li>Add the translated content to the Help Center.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<p>For instructions, see <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/entries/22645797#topic_inn_3qy_43\">Localizing the Help Center</a>.</p>"},{"id":360000053471,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/360000053471.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360000053471-Aerators-and-Scarifiers","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":true,"promoted":false,"position":3,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":115000668711,"created_at":"2018-01-16T11:55:29Z","updated_at":"2018-01-16T11:55:29Z","name":"Aerators and Scarifiers","title":"Aerators and Scarifiers","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2018-01-16T11:55:29Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127732,"label_names":[],"body":null},{"id":115002434391,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/115002434391.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115002434391-The-7-most-common-mistakes-people-make-when-choosing-a-lawn-mower-","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":3,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200261416,"created_at":"2017-10-27T14:46:10Z","updated_at":"2018-02-06T12:41:01Z","name":"The 7 most common mistakes people make when choosing a lawn mower ","title":"The 7 most common mistakes people make when choosing a lawn mower ","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2018-02-06T12:41:01Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115003080251/Fotolia_98327753_XS.jpg\" alt=\"Fotolia_98327753_XS.jpg\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">Buying a lawn mower is easy. Isn't it? Just pick a brand from the hundreds around, pick a blade style, cylinder or rotary, pick a push or self-propelled, choose electric or petrol, choose a working width, then work out if… Yeah OK. Enough. Buying a lawn mower isn’t easy at all. There is a great deal to think about, a maze of choices and you need to make sure you pick the right machine for your lawn. In order to help with this decision, we have come up with a list of seven common mistakes that people make when buying a lawn mower. Read on…</p>\n<p><strong>1. <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Size Matters</span>  </strong>Buying The Wrong Size Lawn Mower For Your Lawn</p>\n<p> Whether you own a lawn large enough to play polo on or one you can step over, buying the right size lawn mower is very important. People often forget this and end up with the wrong size. You don’t want a 62cm working width ride-on if your lawn is the size of a subbuteo pitch and you don’t want to be pushing a 28cm wide cylinder mower around the gardens of Chatsworth House. Larger width mowers will have the ability to mow quicker but, if they are manual propelled, will be harder to push. Think about the size of your lawn. Think about how fast you want to get the job done. Measure your lawn if necessary. As a very, very general rule, for smaller lawns: 28-35cm cutting width, for a medium lawn: 35-40cm and for medium to larger lawns 40cm upwards, with widths of up to 105cm for ride-on mowers designed to cut very large lawns.</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><strong>Cheap As Chips</strong></span>  The Cheapest Mower Is Not Always The Best Option</p>\n<p> This seems like common sense, but it is amazing how many people see a lawn mower as a commodity they need to buy as cheap as possible. Like buying any mechanical or electric device, buying quality nearly always pays dividends in the long run and if you judge your mower purely on price, you could be in for a very short and frustrating ownership period. Look at features, build, and guarantees and, while no one is suggesting you spend money for the sake of it, do spend as much as you can afford on your mower and it will serve you well. </p>\n<p><strong>3. <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">It’s A Non-Starter</span><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"> </span> </strong>Don’t Buy A Mower You Can’t Start</p>\n<p>Again, you would expect that any one with basic common sense would realise that a recoil start takes a certain amount of basic puff and pull to operate. But people don’t always make the connection between recoil and pull. A common reason for distraught calls to manufacturers and retailers is “I can’t start it”. It’s not that petrol machines are extremely hard to start but some people just don’t get on with recoil chords and therefore, it might be worth looking at an electric start machine if you are perhaps older, infirm, or lacking in strength. </p>\n<p><strong>4. </strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><strong>Push It Real Good</strong></span> Don’t Buy A Push Mower If Your Lawn Is On An Incline </p>\n<p>This seems a little extreme but people do often make the mistake of buying a manually propelled lawn mower that just isn’t up to the slopes in their garden. If your lawn resembles the lower slopes of the Himalayas, or is halfway up Machu Pichu a self-propelled machine is probably the best option, unless you are in training for climbing K2 at some stage. Self-propelled mowers have a wide range of drives fitted, some with a simple one-speed and some with several gears including reverse, so look for the one that is right for you.</p>\n<p><strong>5. </strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><strong>In A Spin</strong></span> Don’t Buy A Cylinder if You Need A Rotary (And Vice Versa)</p>\n<p> Rather like the push mower versus self-propelled mower issue, think carefully about the type of grass you have in your garden and the type of terrain you have when you consider buying a lawn mower. Cylinder mowers are not ideal for lumpy gardens so if you can mogul ski on your lawn when it snows, a manual cylinder mower is just not suitable. If you have varying grass types a rotary mower is more suitable for your needs. However, if you have a fairly formal lawn and you are after those smart football pitch, croquet lawn, bowling-green, cricket field type stripes to impress your neighbours then a cylinder mower is absolutely right for you. </p>\n<p><strong>6. </strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><strong>I Got The Power</strong></span><strong> </strong>Don’t Buy A Mower That Is Not Powerful Enough</p>\n<p> It may be tempting to try to save money by buying a mower with a less powerful engine. However, don’t forget that those few kilowatts or horsepower or whatever, could be the difference between a neat lawn and a burned out pile of metal in your garden. If you have grass that is thick or you intend to cut wet grass, you need a certain amount of power and you can seriously overburden your mower by trying to cut too much with too little juice.</p>\n<p><strong>7. </strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><strong>Electric V Petrol</strong></span><strong> </strong>Choose The Right One For You</p>\n<p>Choosing the right power source, electric or petrol, is one of the most fundamental choices, but one that people frequently get wrong.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/lawn-mowers/mains-electric-lawn-mowers\">Mains Electric Lawn Mowers</a> are clean, lightweight, maintenance free and easy to use, but they are really designed for smaller gardens and lawns, due to the restrictions and hazards of the power cable.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/lawn-mowers/petrol-lawnmowers\">Petrol Lawn Mowers</a> are generally more powerful, pretty much ‘go-anywhere’, robust and built for more regular use. They do require a fair amount of maintenance and regular topping up with fresh unleaded fuel.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/lawn-mowers/petrol-lawnmowers\">Cordless Battery Lawn Mowers</a> have the advantages of both and now with the developments in lithium-Ion batteries, they are becoming as powerful as petrol mowers. Watch this space!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/lawn-mowers/automatic-robot-lawn-mowers\">Automatic Robot Lawn Mowers</a> these are ideal if you have no time to mow, or don't want to, and you want to keep the grass short. A certain time is required to set them up and then they pretty much look after themselves, charging themselves when they need it and cutting the grass according to how you programme them. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mowdirect.co.uk/lawn-mowers/hand-propelled-lawn-mowers\">Hand Propelled Lawn Mowers</a></p>\n<p>As they sound, these are cylinder mowers with no means of propulsion or power other than being pushed along. They are, of course, quiet, simple to use and can give you a good workout as well as you garden, but are probably more suited to smaller lawns than an estate sized expanse of grass unless you have a lot of time and energy on your hands. </p>\n<p> So that’s it.

This link will give you the information you need on the oil and fuel and 2-stoke engines in general <a href=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/200995987-Basics-of-the-2-stroke-engine\">Basics of the 2-Stroke Engine</a></span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">3. <strong>Handling &amp; Movement:</strong><em><strong> </strong></em>Before you even turn your hedge trimmer on, try to get used to the weight and feel of it so you do not have an unpleasant surprise when the engine fires up. You don't want to find out it is too heavy for a particular movement when the blades are moving at high speed. Give yourself plenty of space, perhaps outside, and check you are comfortable with handling it before you start. </span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">4.<em> </em><strong>Controls: </strong>Learn and familiarise yourself with all the controls, whether it is a petrol or an electric machine.

The hydrostatic drive uses liquid to transfer power (hydraulics). With this easy-to-use system the acceleration pedal is totally responsive and responsible for all speed changes, with smooth acceleration and infinite control. If you take your foot off the pedal you stop, if you press harder you go faster. This means cornering and obstacle negotiation are easier and more manageable and you generally have more control and mobility around the lawn. </span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong><a href=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201593686-What-is-the-difference-between-manual-automatic-transmatic-and-hydrostatic-drives-in-a-ride-on-mower-or-tractor-\">Manua</a>l:</strong> As it sounds, this is a standard type gear based drive system for a ride-on.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>PTO:  </strong>This stand for 'Power Take-Off' and is the means by which the ride-on transmits power to the mowing deck or other implement, in addition to powering the wheels. </span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Step-Through:</strong> Like a step through bike, some ride-on mowers and tractors are designed so you can step on and off with no obstacles from one side of the driving position to the other, so the steering wheel, pedals etc are not obstructing you when you are mounting or dismounting.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><a href=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201593686-What-is-the-difference-between-manual-automatic-transmatic-and-hydrostatic-drives-in-a-ride-on-mower-or-tractor-\"><strong>Transmatic Drive:</strong></a> A ‘shift-on-the-go’ drive system.

It’s easy to do and it is amazing how many times this simple oversight is the cause of chain oil leaks. An overfilled reservoir can often leak oil when the saw is turned on.  Check this and siphon some off if it looks excessively high. Then power up the saw and see if the leak has subsided.</div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>•An over-oiled guide bar can also cause leakage. To prevent this, remove the chain and clean  the bar with a dry cloth. Then power up the saw and see if it stops</div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>•Possibly the fill plug is not sealing or the oil is leaking through the chain oiling line. </div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>•Clogged oil outlets around the clutch and sprocket can cause leaks if dust or sawdust has got  into them. Clean them out thoroughly and then operate to check if the leak is still there. Your  manual will show you where they are on your particular Chainsaw</div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>•Look at the filler cap and check to see if it has worn out or become faulty or if the seal has  been broken. Replace if so.</div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>•Even after you have emptied the reservoir, the leak could continue if the pump is dirty or  clogged. Check the pump gaskets for wear and wipe clean. Replace if necessary</div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>•If the oil is running out via the delivery line to the bar then there is a chance that the tank vent  is plugged up. If so, the chain may be running 'dry' during operation. Check the vent (see your manual for location) You can clean blocked plugs with wire and an aerosol spray WD40, etc. </div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div> <strong>Engineer’s Tip</strong> – <em>If you want to find out whether your chain is being oiled properly, place a piece of white card or paper on the ground/floor, point the chainsaw down towards it (being careful not to touch the ground) and just rev’ it a little bit. If there is adequate oil on the chain, a fine mist should spray from the guide bar/chain marking the card or paper.</em>\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div> </div>"},{"id":201236123,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/201236123.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201236123-Why-won-t-my-chainsaw-start-","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":3,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200382956,"created_at":"2013-12-05T11:47:57Z","updated_at":"2014-04-23T15:21:16Z","name":"Why won’t my chainsaw start?","title":"Why won’t my chainsaw start?","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2014-04-16T15:17:41Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<div class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"> <img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200695653/Fotolia_44845573_XS.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"273\" height=\"213\">\n</div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">A surprising number of starting issues that our engineers and consultants regularly come up against are due to a simple fact.

This is usually limited to attaching the 'Handlebars' and 'Grass catcher'. </p>\n<p><strong>Fuel: </strong>Your new lawnmower has a 4 Stroke engine, so Oil and Petrol are put in separate compartments, no mixing required.</p>\n<p><strong>Petrol:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Modern fuel contains ethanol, which absorbs moisture and causes the fuel to deteriorate in as little as 30 days, causing damage and starting issues if left in the tank. Our suggested solution is either drain the tank if are going to leave it for a while or always add fuel stabilising additive to all fuel before filling up your tank.</li>\n<li>For the same reasons you should only put 'Fresh Unleaded Petrol' in your tank. Old fuel will degrade quickly if it has not already done so</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Oil:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is important not to under-fill or over-fill your machine. Please refer to your manufacturers guidelines as to the quantity. Regular oil changes protect your engine from damage and excessive wear. Do refer to your ‘Engine’ manual regarding schedules for regular oil changes.</li>\n<li>Not all models come with oil in the box and none with oil in the tank. It is advisable to check and have some ready just in case. The type should be 10/30 Lawnmower Grade Oil, otherwise known as SAE 30.</li>\n<li>Oil needs to be changed after the first 5 hours of use. Running in of the machine can cause minute particles of metal debris in the engine, which an oil change and flush removes safely.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Starting</strong> : If you are have difficulty starting your Mountfield, it is always advisable to check the following: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure you are holding in the 'OPC Bar' (Operator Presence Control). If you are not holding this in you will be unable to pull out the recoil.</li>\n<li>If you have a 'Fuel Switch', please ensure this is on.</li>\n<li>If there is a 'Primer', check you have primed the machine.</li>\n<li>If there is a 'Throttle', check that this is fully on to start the machine and then reduce the throttle once the machine has started.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Throttle:</strong> Again, if there is a throttle on your model, do remember that it does not affect the speed of the machine, it simply reduces or increases the 'Revs' of the engine.</p>\n<p><strong>Storage:</strong> Petrol Lawnmower engines are not waterproof. So make sure you store yours in a dry place, covered if possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Grass and Mud: </strong> Wet and rotting grass causes metal components to rust and grass and dirt in or around the engine can cause overheating and damage. Always make sure you clean the cutting deck regularly and thoroughly.</p>\n<p>If your mower does not have a 'Deck Wash Port' (an attachment for a hose) you will need to tip the machine to clear the deck from beneath. Always tip from front to back so that the machine pivots/rests on the back wheels.</p>\n<p> <strong>NB</strong>: <em>Never tip from side to side as this causes the oil to flood the air filter.   This can contaminate your spark plug and carburettor</em>.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong><strong>Servicing</strong>: Don’t forget that Annual Servicing is recommended by mountfield and is a requirement if you want to extend the guarantee beyond the first year. Out of tune engines and blunt blades can result in poor cutting, poor collection, and environmental pollution.</p>\n<p>We sincerely hope that these guidelines will help you, and that you enjoy your new Mountfield mower.

It is not cool to avoid the manual or instructions, it is foolish and a lot of problems can be avoided buy doing this simple thing. make a cup of tea, sit with your feet up and read it. </span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">2. <strong>Oil and Fuel: </strong>If you have purchased a petrol saw you will need to fill it with oil and fuel. It is likely to be a two-stroke machine, so you will need to mix the fuel and oil carefully. Try this link for more information on the oil and fuel and 2-stoke engines in general <a href=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/200995987-Basics-of-the-2-stroke-engine\">Basics of the 2-Stroke Engine</a></span></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">3. </font><strong style=\"font-size: small;\">Safety Features: </strong><font size=\"2\">You must familiarise yourself with the chainsaw's safety features. All chainsaws have them and they can save your life or limbs. Here is a brief pictorial guide to the safety features you should look out for, with a key below.</font></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200523818/HusSafetychainsaw.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"232\"></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-small\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>A</strong> </span><em>- </em><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Chain brake/hand guard - the guard stops the chain hitting your hand if it breaks and this guard nearly always doubles as the chain brake lever. The chain brake stops the chain moving in emergencies. (<em>see more details below</em>)</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>B</strong> - Location of chain catcher - catches chain if it breaks, protecting operator</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>C</strong> - Nose sprocket - helps prevent kickback and eases chain around the curve of the chain bar</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">D </span></strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">- Throttle safety switch - the throttle is operated by the trigger (E) but it cannot drive the chain unless this switch is also being pressed. This prevents accidental starting.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>E</strong> - Trigger - works with throttle as a 'double-operation' safety trigger</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>F</strong> -  Rear hand-guard</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">4. <strong>Other Controls: </strong>Familiarise yourself with all the controls of your chainsaw, not just the safety features. Have a look at the guide here for more detailed information<a href=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201866838-A-pictorial-guide-to-\"> A Pictorial Guide to The Main Features of A Chainsaw</a></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">5. <strong>Chain tensioning. </strong>Check your manual and makes sure the chain is at the right tension. This is a very important task and you should always do it before you start</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">6. <strong>Chain Lubrication: </strong>The chain has to be lubricated in order to work eland efficiently and safely. follow your manual to see how to lubricate the chain. Some chainsaws have automatic chain lubrication bit, even so ALWAYS check first. Here's how. </span></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Start the saw</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Hold the saw over a white surface without touching it</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Rev the engine</span></li>\r\n<li><font size=\"2\">If a line of oil is left on the surface, the chain is lubricated correctly</font></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">7.<strong> Chain Brake Check</strong>: You should have already identified the chain brake. There is a procedure for checking its function, which should be carried out EVERY time you use it, not just the first time. For details, check your manual thoroughly or go to your manufacturers website. <strong>Do not skip this stage. It is very important.</strong></font></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">8.<strong> Safety Clothing: </strong>Don't even think of starting your chainsaw without first putting on at least the minimum of safety clothing. If you didn't buy any. Go and buy some. This is important and, again, can save life or limb. The VERY MINIMUM we recommend is helmet and gloves but preferably trousers / chaps too for all round protection. If sawing regularly for longer periods awe would recommend heavy duty boots, preferably steel capped.  To see the full range of chainsaw safety clothing available. Try here <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue110\">Safety Clothing</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium wysiwyg-color-black\">9. <strong>N</strong></span><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>uts, Bolts &amp; Screws:</strong> T</span><span style=\"font-size: small;\">hey are unlikely to be loose, but it pays to be careful.</span><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> Check they are all correctly tightened. This is a safety precaution. You do not want to switch.</span><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><em><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><br></span></em></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><font size=\"2\">10. </font><strong><font size=\"2\">Course: </font></strong><font size=\"2\">Think very hard about taking a brief chainsaw safety or operation course. This will give you more confidence to use your saw safely and efficiently.  </font></p>"},{"id":201770557,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/201770557.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201770557-What-hydraulic-oil-should-I-use-in-my-Log-Splitter-","author_id":290886932,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":4,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200382846,"created_at":"2014-03-05T15:11:34Z","updated_at":"2015-04-20T15:30:52Z","name":"What hydraulic oil should I use in my Log Splitter?","title":"What hydraulic oil should I use in my Log Splitter?","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2015-04-20T15:30:52Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Replacing the oil in your Log Splitter should not be too regular an occurrence.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">However, in the event that you do need to do this, we recommend ISO 15.

This will provide a number of gears, usually including a reverse, that offer you a range of speeds, depending on the number of gears provided. </span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Automatic Drive Systems</strong>: These belt and pulley variable drive systems which, like hydrostatic drives, eliminate the need for manual gear changes. The operator only uses the drive pedal to accelerate and needs to use a separate brake pedal to slow down and stop. </span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Transmatic Drive Systems:</strong> These systems use drive-belts and tensioners to control the </span><font size=\"2\">power and therefore the speed, and transfer it to a transaxle. An operator presses the clutch and manually shifts into the chosen speed and then releases the pedal. The difference from manual gears is that the operator does not need to accelerate through the gears as if in a car. He/she would simply choose the speed and then work at that speed. </font></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Hydrostatic Drive Systems:</strong> This totally gear-free system uses hydraulic pumps to control the velocity and direction of the ride-on. Easy to use, the operator simply presses the pedal and the further down, or harder, it is pressed, thew faster the ride-on or tractor moves. This makes it very easy to manage with infinite and detailed speed control and a full stop if the foot is taken off. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><font size=\"2\">Mountfield Petrol Tractor with Pedal Control Hydrostatic Drive</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200512318/MOUNTFIELD_2040_H_PETROL_LAWN_TRACTOR_700W.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"515\" height=\"369\"></span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><em> </em></span></p>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> </span></em></p>"},{"id":202051898,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/202051898.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/202051898-I-ve-received-my-goods-but-have-decided-I-don-t-want-to-keep-them-","author_id":290886932,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":4,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200348108,"created_at":"2014-02-25T14:50:23Z","updated_at":"2020-07-08T11:38:36Z","name":"I've received my goods but have decided I don't want to keep them.","title":"I've received my goods but have decided I don't want to keep them.","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2019-04-11T10:28:54Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">That is not a problem.

So here is a rough guide to some of the words and terms used in snow blowing, to help make your purchase decisions run more smoothly.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Auger</strong> - A bladed cylinder, rather like that in a cylinder lawn mower, that revolves forward on a horizontal axis and clears snow,pushing it back into the body of the blower, and either up and out of the blower (single stage) or back to the impellor (dual stage)</p>\r\n<p><strong>Auger housing</strong> - Also called the intake hood. This is the hollow casing at the front of the snow blower inside which the auger -and impellor in dual stage blowers ) is fitted</p>\r\n<p><strong>Clearing width</strong> - The width of the hood and auger and the path in the snow it will clear. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Deflector</strong> - An adjustable extension or flap on the end of the exit chute (see below) that directs the angle of distribution of the broken snow stream. Usually adjusted by hand or wit a rod, very occasionally in top models it is remotely electronically controlled.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Exit chute - </strong>The chimney or pipe like part of a snow blower that channels the broken down snow away from the machine. It can usually be revolved to change the direction and will also usually have a control to change the height of the flow</p>\r\n<p><strong>Intake height -</strong> The height of the intake hood and therefore the cut off for the depth of snow fall that can be tackled Intake hood Also called the auger housing. This is the hollow casing at the front of the snow blower which gathers the snow and inside which the auger is fitted.(Also houses the impeller in dual stage blowers)</p>\r\n<p><strong>Skid shoes  - </strong>Small metal type fixtures, like rimmed plates, that are bolted to the intake hood to lift the hood and help the snow blower glide along on the snow or ice. They are nearly always adjustable and can enable a blower to work on loose surfaces like gravel and pebbles. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Scraper blade </strong>or<strong> scraper bar</strong>. A long strip of metal, (occasionally strong rubber or rubber encased metal) that is fitted to the underneath of the intake hood and removes excess snow or ice</p>\r\n<p><strong>Single stage</strong> A snow blower featuring just an auger that lifts snow up and out of a chute. Smaller domestic blowers are usually single stage and many are electric</p>\r\n<p><strong>Dual stage</strong> (sometimes called double stage or two-stage) A snow blower featuring both an auger and an impeller. The impeller, which is like a kind of cylindrical fan, revolving on the vertical, sits behind the auger and breaks down the snow even further while forcing the broken snow stream out and away from the blower, much further than a single stage machine is able. Dual stage blowers are always petrol and can be very powerful. Professional blowers are nearly always dual stage.</p>"},{"id":201577143,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/201577143.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201577143-Grass-roots-A-glossary-of-key-lawn-mower-terminology-","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":4,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200261416,"created_at":"2014-01-08T14:48:35Z","updated_at":"2016-03-15T16:49:49Z","name":"Grass roots.

Many of them are explored in more detail elsewhere in these articles. Any term or phrase with more information available in these articles is clickable, so just click if you need to find out more. </span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Ball Bearing Wheels</strong>: Wheels fitted with internal ball bearings decrease friction and increase efficiency, making the wheels run smoother for longer, and are always worth considering, adding to the working life of the machine.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Blade Brake:</strong> A safety mechanism that stops the blades from moving. This protects the operator when removing the rear grass collector from a mower. It is designed to stop the blades without switching off the engine, to avoid constant re-starting and save time</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Cut and Drop:</strong> A basic mowing function where the blades of grass are cut and, rather than being collected, are dropped straight into the ground. This means the clippings help to fertilise the lawn as they break down and contribute organic matter to the growing process. (Not to be recommended if the clippings are clumping)</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><a href=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201583933-What-are-lawn-mower-cutting-decks-made-of-\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue110\"><strong>Cutting Deck</strong></span></span></a>: The body of the mower that surrounds and houses the blade and cutting action. The deck can be made from plastic, steel, or occasionally, alloy (aluminium alloy). The deck provides strength for the mower and protects the operator and plants and animals from the blade.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">Cutting Height</span>:</strong> The height above the soil line that the blades cut to. This is often adjustable (s<em>ee Cutting Height Adjustment below</em>)</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><a href=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201804468-How-do-I-adjust-the-height-on-my-rotary-lawn-mower-\"><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue110\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Cutting Height Adjustment</span></span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">:</span></strong></a> A system by which you can lift or lower the deck to alter the length of the mower’s cut. Usually mechanical, it is generally operated by levers. Methods vary from an individual lever for each wheel, to one lever for front/one for back and, in advanced models, a central lever for the whole deck.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Cutting Width: </strong>This refers to the<strong> </strong>width of cut created by the revolving blade in the cutting deck. This may well be less than the width of the mower itself but this  measurement is the one used to work out how large your mower is and how wide your coverage and cut will be.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><a href=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201581153-Lawn-mower-drive-systems\"><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\" style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Drive System</span>:</strong></a> The method of propulsion for a lawn mower. This varies from push/manual mowers to self-propelled mowers. Drives can be anything from single-speed to multi-geared variable speed, to non gear-change hydrostatic drives with infinite speed control.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Grass Comb:</strong> A series of ridges and grooves built into the front underside of a rotary mower’s cutting deck that disturbs and separates the grass blades, while straightening them for a more even cut.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>High-Wheel:</strong> This usually means the mower has larger diameter wheels at the rear enabling easier turning and manoeuvring.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue110\" style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue110\"><a href=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201581523-What-is-mulching-in-a-lawn-mower-and-what-are-the-advantages-\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Mulching</span></a></span>:</strong></span> A system of cutting where the discharge channel is shut off (<em>Often by a mulch plug, see below</em>) and the blades cut and re-cut the clippings until they are very small. They are then deposited into the lawn where they act as mulch, breaking down and acting as fertiliser to produce a greener lawn</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Mulch Plug:</strong> This is part of the the ‘mulching kit’ that comes with some mowers, enabling the mulching function to work. It pushes into the channel at the rear stopping the clippings from flying back into the collector. Some plugs are separate and some are mechanical and a working part of the mower.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Push:</strong> A mower where your walking propels the mower and the engine/motor only powers the cutting action</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Rear Discharge:</strong> The grass clippings are thrown out to the rear of the machine, either into a grass collector or directly onto the lawn.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Self Propelled</strong>: A lawn mower where the engine powers the wheels as well as the blades.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Side Discharge:</strong> Where side channel distributes the cut grass to the side of the mower. This is useful when conditions are too wet for mulching or collection and when grass is too long and rough. (You should be careful to rake up the grass afterwards though if it is long and sits in piles)</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Swivel Wheels: </strong>Acting rather like castors these wheels add to the longevity of your mower. They are not fixed so, over time, will wear better and not wobble or fall off. They are rare but are becoming more popular. </span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Turf Protecting Wheels: </strong>These are usually extra-wide patterned wheels, or tyres over wheels, that spread the weight of the mower and therefore reduce the amount of visible tracking left on your lawn. Particularly useful if the going is soft. (This can also be aided by using a rear roller machine). </span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue110\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\"><a href=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201810588-How-do-you-start-a-lawn-mower-\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Recoil</span></a></span>:</span></span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> </span></strong>A classic and time-honoured way of starting a lawn mower engine. It involved pulling a starting chord. Many recoil chords these days are mounted on the handle for ease and there are many ‘easy-start’ type systems to reduce the stress of pulling.</span></p>"},{"id":201173407,"url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-gb/articles/201173407.json","html_url":"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201173407-What-is-the-difference-between-clean-and-dirty-water-pumps-","author_id":550411073,"comments_disabled":false,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":4,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":200311153,"created_at":"2014-01-06T14:32:17Z","updated_at":"2015-04-17T11:37:17Z","name":"What is the difference between clean and dirty water pumps?","title":"What is the difference between clean and dirty water pumps?","source_locale":"en-gb","locale":"en-gb","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2015-04-17T11:37:17Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1127752,"label_names":[],"body":"<div class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><strong><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200474713/Fotolia_36302863_XS.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"286\" height=\"265\"></strong></div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>\n<strong>Clean Water Pumps</strong> will be used wherever the water would be unlikely to contain particles, and they tend to operate to between 5 &amp; 10mm minimum height as opposed to the usual 25 - 50mm of a dirty water pump as they don’t need to allow for particles passing through the pump.</div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>(Examples of jobs suitable for Clean Water Pumps include: emptying water tanks, rainwater butts, swimming pools.)</div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\">A Clean Water Pump</div>\r\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://mowdirect.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/article_attachments/200379076/prod-200-Loncin_1_inch_LCLC25ZB21-1.2Q_water_pump.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-small\"><em> </em></span></div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>\n<strong>Dirty Water Pumps</strong> are used for clearing out water that is likely to contain solid particles, so water that is muddy for example.  They tend to work to operate to a minimum water height of 25 - 50mm so that they allow the particles to pass through the pump and avoid blockages.
